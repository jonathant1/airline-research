0,,american-airlines,,H Chisnall,United Kingdom,Economy,1.0,Our flight from MAN to JFK was cancelled due to engine issues which resulted in us having to rebook and we ended up flying via LHR. Our rebooked flight was with British Airways which was much better as they offered individual inflight entertainment systems unlike American who are still on an old system of overhead TVs. Our flight back from JFK was delayed and when we eventually got on board the aeroplane was quite possibly the oldest plane I have been on with a cabin crew to match. After 10 minutes the pilot informed us that a member of American Airlines staff had attempted to open the cabin door when it had already been locked which resulted in the life raft falling off the plane! We had to all disembark and after an hours wait we were told our flight was cancelled and we would need to rebook. We were put on flight the next day via Dublin which resulted us being over 24 hours late home. Appalling service and we will never travel with them again.,2015-08-01,,,1.0,,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,1.0,,0,Manchester to JFK New York,1.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,Couple Leisure,1.0,,,1.0134615384615384,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Cancelled Flight/Flight Attendant
1,Boeing 757,american-airlines,,Jill Halligan,United States,Economy,4.0,We flew from Boston MA to St. Thomas U.S.V.I. on July 14th 2015. Flight #1619 from Boston to Miami was our first leg of the trip and that went smoothly. Then we got onto flight #2421 from Miami to St. Thomas. It was delayed a half hour. We landed in St. Thomas still being able to make our ferry to Tortola. However it took 1 hour and 45 minutes for all of our luggage to be deplaned. During this time three other planes landed all of their luggage was sorted out and the passengers from those planes left the terminal. We found one of our pieces of luggage was still in Miami. Our flight came in at 3.30pm originally supposed to land at 2.57pm. It is well know that ferries stop running from Charlotte Amalie at 4.30pm. American should have done everything in its power to get people on their way. At least one third of the passengers were in the same situation as us. Four others lost baggage. My son spent the next morning trying to reconnect with his luggage and were told we would have to make a trip to the ferry terminal to pick it up. Now on to our flight home July 25th 2015 we arrive at the airport three hours before our flight. The six of us were flying from St. Thomas to Philadelphia PA on flight 837 leaving at 3.05pm. We arrived at the airport at 11.45am. We went to the kiosk and got our plane tickets and then joined the extremely long line (1.5 hours) at the ticket counter just to get our luggage tags.,2015-07-31,,3.0,1.0,4.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,3.0,,0,Boston to St. Thomas via Miami,4.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,FamilyLeisure,2.0,,,0.944047619047619,Lost Luggage/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Long Line

The individual reverse herringbone seats on the 777 are second to none. Privacy and sleeping space are guaranteed. The entertainment is good enough and the flight crew professional and even friendly to some extent. The one downside was the food which was not only below what one would expect for J and not very tasty either. In the transcon similar experience. The full lie flat in J is a nice touch and even getting over the other passenger is not a problem at all. The only major difference was the crew who were a bit more standoffish.,2015-07-31,,3.0,4.0,4.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,8.0,,1,GRU to LAX via GRU,5.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,Solo Leisure,5.0,,,0.8743421052631579,Food

14,,american-airlines,,Jackie Cummings,United States,Economy,1.0,I gave AA a one star rating because I had to choose something. Otherwise I would have given it a negative. This was my worst flying experience and my children's first flying experience. We were supposed to fly out Sunday morning at 7.45 am and due to a mechanical issue the flight was delayed (at first) and ended up getting cancelled. The next flight out was full so we had to take the next available flight at 4.45. Spent all day at the airport waiting to start our Orlando vacation. I was thinking this would be the worst part of our trip - but it wasn't. On the way home - our flight was delayed yet again. We flew out 2 hours after our original flight was scheduled which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Chicago. There were no later flights so we had to stay overnight. When I asked them about a room along with many other passengers we were given a discounted rate at a hotel 15 miles from the airport. The discounted rate was $75 and they didn't offer to pay for a cab (the shuttle wasn't running this late). Rather than taking the room we slept at the airport. Definitely not what you wish for your children's first flying experience.,2015-07-27,,1.0,1.0,1.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,1.0,,0,Kansas City to Orlando,1.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,FamilyLeisure,1.0,,1.0,0.9881578947368421,Cancelled Flight

23,,american-airlines,,Shawn Flynn,United States,Economy,1.0,I am a US college student currently in Buenos Aires Argentina. I was traveling from Columbus Ohio with connections in Washington and Miami. I board in Columbus without any problems however once on board I dealt with rude flight attendants. The flight to Washington arrives to DCA on time I had enough time to board my flight to Miami where I boarded without any problems but once again faced rude flight attendants. Arrive in Miami 20 minutes delayed where I was called up to the counter by an agent where I was asked to switch seats with another passenger because a family was traveling. I paid extra for this seat because all that was left was the preferred seating I asked the agent if I would be moved to a preferred seat she said yes. I get in line to board and am told rudely that I was in boarding group 4 and that they were only boarding group 1 at the moment. I paid extra to be in boarding group 1 and will never again switch seats with someone. Finally am able to board and the safety video plays on the screen on the backs of the seats. The pilot comes over saying that there are two minor problems that need to be taken care of before we can take off. After waiting for over an hour the pilot comes back over the intercom again to explain that we need to deplane. So we got off the plane and wait at the gate for another hour before we are finally told that the flight won't leave until 11.30 the next morning. After waiting forever to speak to the ticket agent and was only offered a transportation voucher.

24,,american-airlines,,Beth Kutcher,United States,Economy,3.0,American is usually okay for me but they aggravated me this time around. I'm assuming the airlines set the flight times. We had a 2 hour layover which is usually enough time but due to the size and unecessary complexity  I already reviewed the airport separately) of Miami airport it was not enough time and we had to run to make final boarding call. I feel like an airline should understand times and how each airport is and should not schedule flights if they know it will be almost impossible for their customers. We were so close to not making it even though we were responsible with booking the layover times. If there is such a risk of passengers not making it don't schedule flights for those times! Part of the problem was the need to claim baggage and recheck it which we were not informed of when we booked the flights. It took far too long for our baggage to come and there was no one around to answer questions about whether or not more baggage was coming. Then after running to make it we still didn't take off on time. We sat for 30 mins at the gate while they fixed some problem in cargo. Some smaller complaints: they did not serve snacks on any of their flights for this trip and they did not show any good entertainment. They kept showing show after show instead of movies and not any good shows either that are popular.,2015-07-25,,1.0,1.0,1.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,3.0,,0,Pamama City to New York via Miami,3.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,Solo Leisure,1.0,,3.0,0.8936274509803922,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems

I don't need outstanding customer service.,2015-07-24,,,1.0,,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,2.0,,0,Denver to Pittsburgh,1.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,Solo Leisure,1.0,,,0.9779411764705882,General

We made them aware we had more connections to get to they couldn't of cared less! After my partner explaining we needed to get home due to commitments etc they put us on a direct flight after they booked it then told us it was to Heathrow airport which is 45 mins from where our car was in Gatwick. Advised that the airline would pay for our bus journey so we took it. When we arrived in Heathrow our nightmare continued as American airlines had now lost our luggage. When we realised the luggage was missing we went to a help desk just to file a report and to be told to go home and our luggage should arrive later that day and all will be ok.

34,Boeing 737,american-airlines,,William Gustin,United States,Economy,2.0,Flight from Boston to O'Hare fair to good. Basic experience. AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight and just not a whole lot of explanation. Yes the rain did cause part of the delay but really no responsibility was attributed to the airline for the other factors that weighed into the cancellation. I am now flying home on a competitor along with at least 5 others I recognize from that fateful night.,2015-07-17,,1.0,1.0,,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,2.0,,0,Boston to Orange County via O'Hare,2.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,Business,2.0,,,0.9433333333333334,Cancelled Flight

Took an hour to remove another hour to install and then testing began. After 2 hours of delay given $12 meal voucher. You can't even buy a pre-made sandwich at ORD for that amount.

Predictably the flight was late arriving which was fine as the connecting flight to LAX also was delayed. To 10 am. Then 11 am. Then the sign at the gate said to check at 3 pm. The aircraft was having ""maintenance"" issues which I learned only by calling the Platinum Desk. The plane was removed from the gate and taken back to the hangar. We were told we'd be boarding at 3.30 pm. And some of us - perhaps 10 - did board only to be told to disembark. The pilot had ""timed out"" after waiting around all day like the rest of us. A few minutes before 4 pm another pilot showed up and boarded the plane but he strode off after a few minutes. The flight was then canceled altogether. I managed to secure a seat on a 6.17 pm flight to LAX via Chicago. In the meantime I complained to a gate agent about the inadequate service and ""surly ill-mannered uncommunicative"" agents. The flight to Chicago eventually took off and we connected from there to LAX arriving at the California airport around 11.15 pm. My original itinerary had me arriving at 11.29 am.

We had to go back through airport security as if we had arrived in the country! All our duty free was taken off us. We then had to re-queue at check-in for over an hour and a half staff were rude brusque and aloof. Told that our only options were to cancel altogether or fly 9.5 hours later to Heathrow via British Airways. As we only had 3 nights in New York we would lose a third of our trip. We asked to come back a day later so we would actually get the trip that we had paid for meaning adding on the day we lost onto the end of our holiday but they wouldn't honour this.

On June 21st we drove 2 hours to Charlotte Airport and on our way we got an automated call telling us our flight had been cancelled for maintenance (at around 11.30) on a beautiful clear day.

This wasn't an acceptable alternative for us so we were put on standby for a 4.30 flight but then we had to check-in our stowaway luggage. We asked how we would get our luggage back if we didn't make it on the 4.30 flight and were told that the luggage was marked for standby and would not be put on the plane without us. Past security we checked with other United Airways employees who assured us this was the case. These employees were all helpful and patient with us.

81,,american-airlines,,Steven Husng,United States,Economy,2.0,"American Airlines displayed appalling customer service to its stranded passengers in PHL on the evening of 30 June 2015. Several of us were late by minutes to connecting flights to Europe after being encouraged to run to catch our connections all flights left without the 15-20 of us. These things sometimes happen but what followed was not acceptable. Customer service representatives had no solutions for anyone other than bookings for the next flight 24 hours later. No hotel transportation nothing. My service at the desk was dismissive: we can't help. We have no solutions or contingencies. It was only after my pestering them when she handed me the dreaded ""pink slip"" - a generic phone number and website for ""discount"" on a hotel. The biggest problem is that customer service failed spectacularly at the point where the client is most vulnerable and alone-in transit. There should be a representative for each imperiled connecting flight or group of flights. On-ground coordinators should be communicating with gate agents and in-flight attendants. Even when connections are simply impossible let us know and give us options at the point of debarkation. All it takes is for someone to actively monitor and question the line.

When landing in Dallas I had an hour to get to my other flight (or so I thought). We sat on the runway for over an hour which of course we were not informed as to what was taking so long. The only thing that made the flight bearable is the fact there was movie service from the flight from Dallas to Las Vegas ($8 for a movie). I attempted to just check in online for my flight leaving tomorrow morning only to find out it told me my request could not be processed and I had to check in at the airport. I called the customer information number listed on the website only to be told it wasn't processing because I did not have a seat on my connecting flight from Dallas to Monroe.

120,,american-airlines,,Matthew Butler,United States,Economy,2.0,"Throughout my recent trip there were difficulties due to under-staffing at the terminals and ticket check-in leading to several long delays. Several of us missed our first flight out of Gainesville since there was miscommunication leading to no one being at the check-out counter prior to our departure and none of the boarding pass kiosks working. The return flights were equally difficult with only 1 kiosk working and only one person working the ticket counter which lead to check-in requiring about an hour. Several of the initial flights were delayed leading to several of us missing our connection. While this is understandable and does occur at times it took approximately 2 hours to receive our hotel vouchers even though the flight arrangements were made prior. This was again due to being under-staffed as only 1 person was working this terminal. The following day multiple flights were cancelled due to ""mechanical difficulties"" leading several of us to again miss our flights. This again lead to an almost 2 hour wait in order to re-book after already waiting an hour prior to the flight being cancelled causing many of us to miss our chance at making a compatible connection flight. I was initially told I would again have to stay over-night and was not given further options. After calling customer service myself I found a flight to an airport 2.5 hours away although I was required to pay the rental car fee to drive back home. In summary due to consistent under-staffing there were numerous long waits which ultimately delayed travel planned. This combined with several flight delays (due to mechanical difficulties - not weather) lead do my initial flight leaving a day late and my return flight being delayed 2 additional days. I travel fairly regularly and have never ran across this issue previously. I will avoid using American Airlines in the future if possible.",2015-06-17,,1.0,1.0,2.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,1.0,,0,Gainesville to Wichita via Miami and Dallas,3.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,Business,1.0,,1.0,1.0315040650406504,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Cancelled Flight/Food

The delay was exceptional. Before I even knew that there were two workers behind the counter and both were tied up. One had a problem with an international traveler couple. Second a family had their flight canceled or rescheduled. American was attempting to help but the mother refused the offer of a taxi because she requested a carseat (which is understandable).

passengers were seated and the safety video shown they said there was another mechanical problem (didn't identify it) and sent all 200 of us to a re-booking desk which couldn't possibly accommodate all of us.  Meanwhile after an hour standing in line they called us back to the second airplane and the ones of us who hadn't left in search of another flight toted rolling bags etc on board yet a third time and we sat and continued to wait while the baggage was loaded. This leg of the trip had begun with the supposed 12.25 pm departure of Flight 2407 but by now it was 5.30 pm with no signs of hope. I knew I'd already missed my connecting flight to SLC and was able to book another DFW flight for 6 pm.  I made it in time to board this different flight but the 6.00 departure time turned out to be 7.00pm.  The delay here was for yet another unexplained reason.  Still  I was able at DFW to make my connecting flight to SLC on a 10.00 flight but this interminable day stretched out far longer than it should have and I don't see how it could be that every single AA flight I was on that day all had delays. The staff were friendly and helpful but I can't recommend this airline.

What's more shocking is not having an individual screen for each passenger. moreover on the Paris-Miami flight the steward was not nice at all. While the hostess gave me a can of coke he only gave me a glass. The food was ok but very low quality compared to the price paid.

170,,american-airlines,,J Elkins,United States,Economy,0.0,I flew from Orlando to Barcelona on May 6th with a return on May 18th. It was by far one of my worst experiences in commercial flying. The reasoning for this rating is extensive and ranges from their computer changing my times and seats three times from reservation to flight to inoperative bathroom in flight to massive delays both ways ranging from almost 2 hours to cool down an aircraft cabin before boarding to waiting over 2 hours for flight attendants to arrive in Miami from Philadelphia. It is obvious that no longer is the passenger important but rather all the extra charges and cramped seating that rule the day. In terms of choosing an airline carrier it is sadly my opinion that airlines such as KLM or Lufthansa offer better service and would be my first choices on international flights.,2015-05-25,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,1.0,,0,,0.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,2.0,,,1.0037037037037038,Flight Attendant

Both flights fine with slightly early arrivals and no drama - Obviously older planes showing some wear and tear but comfortable with standard First class seats. FA tending to First Class on the ORD-SAT leg was excellent hard working attentive continuously present in the cabin to tend to the passengers also a bit more formal (in a good way) less chatty (again good) and obviously concentrating on delivering a good service. FA on the second leg more relaxed in delivering service but still ok. Catering for the first (evening) leg was a chicken or pasta choice with the chicken dish bland and just barely edible. Not good enough even for economy on many other airlines. Also strange that AA considers the chicken or pasta choice a First Class offering on a three hour dinner time flight probably only possible on the US market. Wines served were ok and regular refills offered by the good FA. First Class breakfast RNO-ORD leg was cereal with no other option. Again how this can be considered a First Class breakfast for a four hour flight is beyond me. Good premium check-in with no significant lines and manned counters in both ORD and RNO boarding professional and painless.

Sat in airport all day to find out at around 3pm that the flight had been cancelled due to a technical issue. No information from the staff all day. Had to find out what was going on via the website. The flight got rescheduled for Monday. After another hour delay we finally boarded the same aircraft that they where having issues with the previous day. We set off to the runway only to turn back with a technical issue. We were then sat onboard the aircraft for a further 6 hours as they where having the same issues as the previous day. After the 6 hours we where informed that the flight was being cancelled yet again. By this time it was to late to make alternative arrangements. The downfall for me was the job I should have been at on Monday morning had to be cancelled as I could only get there by Wednesday.

178,,american-airlines,,C Kidd,United States,Economy,2.0,I flew Baltimore to Seoul (BWI-DFW-ICN) on 10 May 2015 the flight out of Baltimore had to return to the gate due a cockpit display not working making the flight an hour late on take off. We were then diverted due to weather - admittedly the crew were helpful during our enforced 4 hour plane-bound ground stop in Austin. We finally got to Dallas 5 hours late – ‘to be greeted by a (non-existent) customer representative’ the queue for the customer service at C25 was pathetic – two people and a queue of several hundred snaking around the terminal. Fortunately I had my BA executive card and got into the Admirals lounge were the queue was only about 20 people. We (three of us) were rebooked on the flight to Narita (Japan) and onto Seoul the following day. Although technically that flight would have left technical ‘issues’ meant that we left 7.5 hours late arriving in Narita at about 11pm. What a contrast - upon arrival there were about 15 Japanese customer service people with individual ‘packages’ for passengers containing onward boarding passes details of buses to pre-arranged hotel accommodation and a food box. Next day a special bus took us back to the airport for our onward flight to Seoul. Our luggage was not so lucky – even with the 7 hour delay at Dallas AA was unable to send our luggage out for another 2 days! The return flight was ‘better’ – in that there wasn't a delay but the flight was cramped – the 777 clearly had not been ‘spring cleaned’ since its delivery many many years ago the food was mediocre at best and the ‘entertainment system’ simply because it was entertaining trying to find anything of interest to watch/listen to. Quite simply AA (as do other US carriers) provided the absolute bare minimum. Unfortunately it is ‘company policy’ to only fly American carriers – and probably the only reason that American carriers still exist.,2015-05-18,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,1.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,0.9656288156288156,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food

The Heathrow flight was on time and the service was ok but not great. A little too ""matter of fact"" if I can use that term. Our flight from DFW was a different affair. Because we couldn't book our seats we were advised to ask at the desk at Dallas. When we arrived I was impressed that they knew we were coming but added"" we think we have four seats spare but leave it with us"". I had already had trouble booking seats from Heathrow with not wanting to pay and extra £30 pre booking fee! We eventually did get 4 seats. 2 at the front and two at the back.

195,,american-airlines,,J M Shaw,United Kingdom,Economy,1.0,"As two couples we traveled Heathrow to Palm Springs via Dallas Fort Worth. The Heathrow flight was on time and the service was ok but not great. A little too ""matter of fact"" if I can use that term. Our flight from DFW was a different affair. Because we couldn't book our seats we were advised to ask at the desk at Dallas. When we arrived I was impressed that they knew we were coming but added"" we think we have four seats spare but leave it with us"". I had already had trouble booking seats from Heathrow with not wanting to pay and extra £30 pre booking fee! We eventually did get 4 seats. 2 at the front and two at the back.

201,,american-airlines,,Peter Pomeranze,United States,First Class,5.0,I am quite happy to write a positive review of my experience yesterday. Flying from Honolulu to LA on a 757 I was expecting very little. Instead I was welcomed by a warm crew to a comfortable seat and received warm attentive service. The breakfast was quite nice and beverages were free flowing and offered in a friendly manner. The entertainment on a screen ahead was minimal and that was the only second rate part of the trip. The pillow and blanket offered were large and comfy. I hope this signals an upgrade system-wide for a product that has long called for one.,2015-04-30,,5.0,,2.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,8.0,,1,,4.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,5.0,,,0.7184794372294372,General
202,,american-airlines,,Eric Allen,United States,Economy,1.0,"Will not be flying with this airline again. Was traveling from Seattle to Houston Hobby through DFW. Plane was delayed on the runway for over an hour because American couldn't communicate with their own computer system in Dallas. Because of the delay we landed in DFW just 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to leave in another terminal. Hauled over to that terminal only to see a completely different flight posted at my gate with no agents in site. Found another gate with an agent and told him my situation. He put me on standby for another flight to Houston. I was called from the standby list and put on that flight they asked me to gate check my bag. Then after I was seated they called me off the airplane saying they had double booked my seat! They could not return my bag to me. Put me on yet another flight to Houston for two hours later. But that gate listed information for another flight. Talking with other customers it became clear that none of the gates displayed the appropriate flights it was utter chaos with agents switching gates for flights every 15 minutes or so and disgruntled passengers everywhere. Meanwhile it turns out that the flight they kicked me off of was cancelled because the pilot had reached his maximum number of hours before the flight ever left. Everyone on that flight was moved to my new flight. Eventually they boarded the flight and then sat at the gate for an hour because as the captain put it ""someone who needs to be on the flight is not on it."" The passenger sitting next to me showed me radar on her phone indicating that a storm was rolling in that would prevent us from leaving if we didn't leave soon. Many passengers started shouting to the crew asking why we hadn't left yet and many openly started wondering if the crew was actually making excuses to delay the flight until it was cancelled. Remember that many of these passengers had been on a cancelled flight just a few hours before. Anyway the captain did wait long enough that a storm rolled in as predicted. We were told we would need to fly out of the other side of the airport and circle around the storm so we taxied over. Once we were all the way on the other end we were told the new route required more fuel than we had so we had to return to the gate. Then we were told the ramp was closed so there was no gate for us to refuel at so we had to just wait. Finally a gate opened up for us but we just sat there for another hour. Then the captain told us that he reached his maximum number of flying hours so the flight was cancelled.

219,,american-airlines,,Fred Davidson,United States,Economy,2.0,"Wife and I booked a trip from Houston to see the son in West Palm Beach on 4/17/2015. Our flight was supposed to be one of the first that left that day so we were ate the airport very early. Check in was 4 am. Of all the flights in the entire airport ours was delayed 2 hours. Why? Because they said it did not get in till late the previous day. Well that delay messed up our connecting flight in Dallas-Fort Worth so the day got worse and our total day was extended 6-7 hours. I understand that there are times when issues cannot be avoided but the airline booking personnel just didn't seem to care. We paid extra for the priority seating but they just threw us in the pool of last place seating until we got in their face. They did give us a meal voucher good for one of the vendors in the airport but only when we had to demand it. The pilot explained that there are rules of mandatory rest between flights which we understand but that news was known the previous day so why did we not get notified? The connecting flight was also delayed due to maintenance of passenger seats. For our return flight home my wife and I were praying for no issues but American Airlines made sure that we would not go home happy. The flight from West Palm Beach to Dallas-Fort Worth was pretty routine in the air but flight was delayed leaving the airport due to some ""auxiliary power"" issue that maintenance had to remedy before take off. When we arrived in Dallas-Fort Worth the powered boarding shute needed maintenance's attention before we could exit the plane into the terminal so we had to wait for that fix. As luck would have it our connecting flight was delayed another 1.5 hours! I will definitely find another airline before I choose this one again.

I understand that there are times when issues cannot be avoided but the airline booking personnel just didn't seem to care. We paid extra for the priority seating but they just threw us in the pool of last place seating until we got in their face. They did give us a meal voucher good for one of the vendors in the airport but only when we had to demand it. The pilot explained that there are rules of mandatory rest between flights which we understand but that news was known the previous day so why did we not get notified? The connecting flight was also delayed due to maintenance of passenger seats. For our return flight home my wife and I were praying for no issues but American Airlines made sure that we would not go home happy. The flight from West Palm Beach to Dallas-Fort Worth was pretty routine in the air but flight was delayed leaving the airport due to some ""auxiliary power"" issue that maintenance had to remedy before take off. When we arrived in Dallas-Fort Worth the powered boarding shute needed maintenance's attention before we could exit the plane into the terminal so we had to wait for that fix. As luck would have it our connecting flight was delayed another 1.5 hours! I will definitely find another airline before I choose this one again. The money you save does not justify the agony or grief this airline dishes out.",2015-04-23,,3.0,,2.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,2.0,,0,,4.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,2.0,,,0.9365972222222222,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food
221,,american-airlines,,V Jones,United States,Premium Economy,1.0,I was scheduled to fly from DFW to HOU Flight 5770 departing DFW 3.10pm arriving in HOU. Instead they notified us that there was no plane. We didn't have a plane to board until 5.30pm and the plane didn't depart until 6.20pm that evening. Over a 3 hour delay due to not having an available plane. Before we took off the pilot notified us that due to weather they were going to have to take a more Western route and were not sure if they were going to have enough fuel. Instead of actually getting more fuel we took off anyway. 30 min into the flight they notified us that there was a line to land into HOU due to weather and that they didn't have enough fuel and needed to land in San Antonio. Not only did we not get into SA until 8pm but the crew notified us that they had flown too many hours. So even if we did get more fuel there was no crew to fly the plane. At this point we were stranded in San Antonio and the weather had become so bad in Houston there were no planes out. We were stranded. After 2 hrs waiting in line the representative informed me I could not get back to Hobby until 7.30pm Monday. Monday I flew back to DFW 1433 to catch another plane 1489 to get to IAH by 12 noon. I took a cab from IAH to Hobby where my car was at b/c this was a better option than waiting all day to get back home. Practically over 24 hours to fly from DFW to HOU. I am extremely dissatisfied with American that I will no longer be flying this airline.

239,,american-airlines,,N Hammond,United Kingdom,Economy,1.0,My husband and our teenage son went to visit family in Nashville for two weeks this Easter. We booked our four flights each London-Chicago-Nashville and back through BA. BA were supposed to take us as far as Chicago with American Airlines doing the Chicago to Nashville bit. We missed our connection at both legs of the journey which was hugely inconvenient particularly when returning to the UK. To be fair AA brought us back to Chicago airport in time but for some reason the they were not given a gate for more than an hour. I approached the flight attendant asking whether AA can communicate with BA about this delay particularly as there were several people apart from us who were due to catch the same flight. She said that the flight will probably wait for us they know that we are being delayed. This resulted in a mad run between terminals 3 and 5 in vain. We were then sent back to AA desk in Terminal 3 to rebook our tickets for another flight. AA staff took a very long time to process each person. By the time we finished it was more than 1.5 hrs after we started queuing. We were told that the we will be put on AA flight to London tomorrow afternoon. There are many flights between London and Chicago and we requested an earlier flight. The person dealing with us said that if we wanted tickets to an earlier flight we should have come earlier. She refused to check whether BA had any flights the next day. In fact they were as unhelpful as possible.

240,,american-airlines,,N Hammond,United Kingdom,Economy,1.0,My husband and our teenage son went to visit family in Nashville for two weeks this Easter. We booked our four flights each London-Chicago-Nashville and back through BA. BA were supposed to take us as far as Chicago with American Airlines doing the Chicago to Nashville bit. We missed our connection at both legs of the journey which was hugely inconvenient particularly when returning to the UK. To be fair AA brought us back to Chicago airport in time but for some reason the they were not given a gate for more than an hour. I approached the flight attendant asking whether AA can communicate with BA about this delay particularly as there were several people apart from us who were due to catch the same flight. She said that the flight will probably wait for us they know that we are being delayed. This resulted in a mad run between terminals 3 and 5 in vain. We were then sent back to AA desk in Terminal 3 to rebook our tickets for another flight. AA staff took a very long time to process each person. By the time we finished it was more than 1.5 hrs after we started queuing. We were told that the we will be put on AA flight to London tomorrow afternoon. There are many flights between London and Chicago and we requested an earlier flight. The person dealing with us said that if we wanted tickets to an earlier flight we should have come earlier. She refused to check whether BA had any flights the next day. In fact they were as unhelpful as possible. I made a point that we paid tickets for the flight that just left and had we managed to be on it we would not be asking for anything.

247,,american-airlines,,R Golledge,United Kingdom,Economy,3.0,LHR-DFW return on 777-300ER. I booked this route especially to take this newer plane for the inflight entertainment which did not disappoint. I found the crew okay and some even smiled! What I disliked about AA was the exorbitant prices they charge for pre-allocated seats which was a necessity in order to seat a family of 4 together. The food was mostly below average but having read reviews I wasn't surprised. I don't like the way they have chosen to add another seat to each row in economy. So instead of 9 abreast they have made it 10. This makes the aisle ridiculously narrow and I don't see how hundreds of people would be able to escape in an emergency so I'm surprised the FAA permits this higher density seating. Legroom was tight for anyone of above average height. I also found it strange how the seat belt sign was illuminated for virtually the whole flight - in both directions - and there are hardly any announcements from the flight deck even when turbulence is quite choppy. I chose AA for the equipment they use on this route but I would think twice about booking them again due to the hidden costs that aren't factored into the ticket price.,2015-04-12,,2.0,,4.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,5.0,,0,,2.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,0.940595238095238,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food

251,,american-airlines,,Neil Snee,United Kingdom,Business Class,5.0,LHR-MIA March/April. We were sold this round trip on the 'new' AA Business Class product. We knew it was a 777-300ER LHR-MIA and a 777-300 back. The outbound was fantastic with great service seats AVOD and everything one should expect from a modern BC cabin. we have flown Emirates BC 4 times in the past 6 months and this cabin is comparable to both the A380 and the 777 in that class defining airline. Whilst we found the service in Emirates a bit disorganised AA was efficient friendly and warm we like the more mature no nonsense crew on Airlines out of the States although it's a thin line to rude and dis-interested on occasions! However AA should be ashamed scheduling a 200 version for the return leg which was not a result of a last minute 'change out' due to failure but that quote ' The newer plane has been stolen for Los Angeles some weeks ago'. Call me sad but I would have changed my flight if I'd known we'd be on this antique! Lie at an angle beds a 10 inch screen maybe 11 low def (love the jumpy fuzzy effects reminded me of the 90s) and the general feel of a very tired plane! What was different was the excellent service and food I was annoyed when I sat down but slept for 3 hours and was relaxed when I got off. AA has begun to catch up it's got some way to go and given the lounge experience (don't ever ever call sparkling wine Champagne!) there is a way to go the crew are spot on and at the end of the day that's what makes a flight. Seat score is for the 777-300ER but oddly it's not great for couples as these seats are very. 'Pod' like and chatting to each other isn't easy AVOD score is the new plane.,2015-04-12,,4.0,,5.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,7.0,,1,,5.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,3.0,,,0.9543350168350168,Food

That's where the complements end though. I have never flown with a worse cabin crew. They all wore different clothing as though they had turned up from home and not bothered to change. They were totally uncommunicative - amazingly not a word was spoken to us through the entire journey. One of the crew fell asleep in a seat at the back of the cabin. Food was served as though they were doing us a favour and just dropped in front of us without a word there was not a friendly smile between them. One of the crew was not tall enough to close the overhead lockers.

On arrival at Manchester the airline staff quizzed us in detail about where else we usually travelled to why we were going to the States what jobs we did. This took about 10 minutes. Check in was via a machine designed to make AA a staff saving however it did nothing for their customers most of whom were frustrated at its inability to work. The whole crew were late and ran through the airport together to take up their posts. Did this account for them not checking whether the passengers had on their seat belts or arm rests in the correct position? Apparently not as it was exactly the same on the return flight. The safety video could not be viewed by passengers seated by the window due to the low overhead and central hanging videos. Did the crew have a uniform? They all dressed differently some wore extensive amounts of jewellery and chewed gum others had not even combed or tidied their hair. All were markedly scruffy compared to every other airline I have ever flown with. More worrying was that none of the crew advised passengers to remain seated when the seat belt light was lit and passengers proceeded to walk around the cabin throughout the flight. Or maybe it was the Captain's error in not turning the light off at all. Who knows whether we even had a Captain as on the out flight no announcements were even made! Not impressive on safety at all. Lets face it food comfort etc are also important but if an airline fails on basic safety the rest pales to insignificance.,2015-03-28,,2.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,1.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,0.9852272727272727,Food
267,,american-airlines,,Kay Molen,United States,Economy,1.0,I have the time to write this review due to the third delay I've had with this airline. Not a single good thing I can say about my experience with American. I have flown Southwest Delta Jetblue Frontier and this is by far the worst airline I have flown. We had an hour and a half delay the first flight plus an emergency situation so we missed our connecting flight which has never happened to me. They supplied us with the worst hotel overnight. It wasn't just us that missed our flight 5 other families on separate ones missed theirs too. Then the flight the next day got delayed 30 minutes! So our three day trip turned into one day from all the delays and missed flights. Finally heading home and they announce mechanical problems with the plane. So now the flight is delayed 2 hours and we are missing our connecting flight to Salt Lake. So we get to board on a 6 pm flight but let's not kid ourselves that'll be delayed too so probably 7. And then it's a 4.5 hour flight so I'll be getting home at 2am.

274,,american-airlines,,B Robinson,United States,Economy,3.0,Flew RDU-LHR on a free economy ticket. I prefer other airlines but the RDU-LHR non-stop convenience trumps all. It also gives me the opportunity to judge the progress of the AA/USAir merger. On the downside the venerable 767-300 is one year older (27 years and counting) still has the mail slot overhead storage bins the ancient hanging screen entertainment and the excruciatingly uncomfortable seats. I did notice that this old warhorse had been updated with blended winglets to save money which I'm certain they pass along to those paying for tickets. On board the hot breakfast croissant has been replaced with a box of sugar laden treats and the dinner has regressed from merely uninteresting to inedible. The flight attendants are excellent given what they have to work with - even giving up their crew rest seats to accommodate the spring breakers who made this a 100% full flight. On the plus side a current movie that I had considered paying to see (Whiplash) swift check-in and 45 minutes early into LHR. AA doesn't seem challenged to upgrade their transatlantic game but unless you're flying from RDU there must be a better option to get from the U.S. to the UK.,2015-03-18,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,3.0,,1,,2.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,5.0,,,0.8995748299319728,Food/Flight Attendant

280,,american-airlines,,A Goddard,United Kingdom,Economy,2.0,London - Miami Return January 2015 (Boeing 777). I could only choose where I wanted to sit 24 hrs before my flight which was fine as most airlines have that policy but what really threw me back was that all aisle and window seats cost an extra $69 - $100 each way depending where the seat was located! You have to pay extra for an aisle seat at the back of the plane on a 10hr transatlantic flight? This is not easyjet or Ryanair for goodness sake! The so called cheap flight on a major airline was not so cheap after all as they were already nickel and diming before getting off the ground. I refused to pay and went for a free middle seat which I loath I have wide shoulders and have to hunch inwards my plan was to arrive early and hope the check-in desk could sort me out with an aisle seat which they were able to do but that is where the Customer satisfaction stopped.) Plane was on time and boarding was reasonably quick and I was perched in my aisle seat which was very narrow I also noticed many people getting their roller cases stuck in the aisles as they tried to roll them down but it turns out that in an effort to squeeze an extra seat in each row American Airlines compromised with narrower seats and aisles. In the air nightmare #1 The narrow aisle caused one particular cabin crew to bump the trolley into my shoulder or elbow without even so much as an apology. #2 You get free beer and wine but the entire cabin ran out beer and white wine before the first drinks trolley finished its first pass. #3 The plane was old and the only movies available played at set times (not on demand) that's right 2015 with 90s technology - AA may have painted their planes but they are still old and nasty inside. Worst of all it was the same experience on the return leg mercifully the flight was 60 mins less - A truly awful transatlantic flight!,2015-03-17,,1.0,,2.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,2.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,0.9479335317460318,Flight Attendant

Instead of lie- flat seats they still offer lie in s-style and be careful not to slip down to the floor while you sleep. Stewardess climbing over me to cut off the way she had to walk. Food was disappointing as well. Only highlight was the wine selection that was a little bit better than ok. No way that I will use AA again.,2015-03-17,,2.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,1.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,1.0168055555555555,General

297,,american-airlines,,D Ruckel,United States,Economy,3.0,I traveled reluctantly on American Airlines Buenos Aires - New York and return in early December 2014. On the most recent trip I can only say that the seating was horrible the flight attendants inattentive. I did like two attendants on the return flight one a male who saw the girl sitting next to me unwilling to put her tray up for takeoff and he firmly said 'you know the drill put the tray up'. You could sense his professionalism and no nonsense approach. He was quite professional. Another attendant was very personal with me and admitted that flying was not what it used to be said that the 777-300 had two back seats that you could not recline and actually defended the passenger in terms of lack of comfort. She said that now it is a question of bringing your own entertainment food all of which surprised me since she was not party line and quite personable apologizing for making me wait ten minutes for some water saying 'I'm sorry I'm in another world today' not so reassuring but she was on top of things. A mixed bag. On the flight to New York the food was awful but a flight attendant when telling her that I need a lot of water subtly gave me an entire bottle in a plastic bag. Perhaps it's because I helped an older passenger with her luggage but still what a shocker. I find that I am very uncomfortable getting off their planes. They have twice lost my luggage once on an earlier flight but found it days later. The latest was really just uncomfortable because of the 2x5x2 seating arrangement on a 777-200. I cannot recommend them for comments like 'whose the next victim?' or 'the entertainment system is not working. We suggest you read a good book and go to sleep'. This was on a flight Buenos Aires New York about three years ago stated in Spanish and English by a flight attendant. Passengers laughed but you could see many were offended by her suggestions.

303,,american-airlines,,R Stagg,Canada,First Class,2.0,"I had an unpleasant experience with this airline on Sunday March 1st. I took a flight from Houston to Chicago then had an hour to connect to my flight to Toronto. The first leg was fine on time and was surprised that a meal was served on a short two hour flight. I got to Chicago checked the departure board and saw my flight was delayed an hour. That was not too bad so I used the washroom came out to get a coffee and decided to check the board for the gate again and to my surprise my flight was then listed as cancelled. Told that even though I had booked first class if I wanted to get to Toronto the next morning it would be in the back of economy told that the only first class available would be in two days. The biggest surprise came shortly thereafter when I went to search for a Customer Relations desk: there was none! There was a system of phones. Eventually a CS agent came to the phone. She told me that the previous gate agent booked me for the following night from Chicago to Philadelphia then a six hour wait to board a 7 am flight back up to Toronto getting me to my destination two days after the original time. I instead took charge and asked if I could get a flight to Buffalo and was placed on one for two hours later. Of course ""weather"" was the cause for the delay but oddly enough only my flight was showing up as being cancelled. I fly often so if weather was a major factor the board should have at least a few more cancellations or delays. Because of this ""weather"" excuse there would be no assistance for a hotel. I was to depart from the L gates and just before boarding there came an announcement that we had to go over to the H gates- - with just minutes to spare. Service has been much better to me by other US based airlines when faced with unusual changes such as weather or mechanical delays-I have had them all.

Once the time finally comes to board the flight bound to MSP we get onto the plane which previously came from Mexico City. The flight attendants were very welcoming however they then tell us over the speaker that this plane was out of service and that American Airlines must find us a new plane to fly on. So we get all of our luggage off the plane and leave the gate once again tired and exhausted.

332,,american-airlines,,M Baughman,United States,First Class,5.0,"I am mostly an international flyer on Qatar Etihad and BA. I have been flying American a lot in the US in the past 18 months and have to say I have been pleasantly surprised. This weekend there was a bad storm that closed Washington area airports and I had to get back from Miami to make an international departure the following day. Two of my flights were cancelled. The agent at the Admirals Club stuck with it for almost an hour as we strategized a way to get near enough to DCA so I could have options to get home (eventually I got to PHL and rented a car). The only slightly sour note was the agent's supervisor came over saying ""no...no...no.."" and she couldn't be bothered with trying to understand what we were trying to do. Seeing I was now getting really angry the supervisor pulled back and the agent got me near enough on a USAir flight. USAir had their own agent in the Club and he got us on a waitlist for an even earlier flight which proved to be a Godsend. And after all that my baggage eventually made it to DC after the storm with no drama. Of course I am Oneworld Gold and we were flying first class and I didn't have to stand in a mile long line in the main terminal. But that's what you're paying for and often US airlines don't treat you very well no matter how much you paid for the ticket. I also have found AA is incredibly helpful on the phone in changing reservations even on codeshare flights which is something I have to do frequently. Their website is extremely good and links nicely with other airlines if you are on a complicated itinerary that includes one of their flights. I know people who gripe about them but for now they're my go-to US airline.",2015-02-24,,3.0,,3.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,9.0,,1,,4.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,4.0,,,0.9452777777777778,Long Line/Cancelled Flight

339,,american-airlines,,J Gardner,United States,First Class,3.0,LAX-DFW-MEX and return - First/Business Class. My expectations were set fairly low as these were my 11th and 12th transit of DFW on American over the last 6-7 years but wanted to burn off some miles. Of these trips I can now say that 2 have departed on time out of this place. That said my trip down to MEX was uneventful. Food was fair at best and F/A's smiles seemed missing but was on time. The departure out of MEX back to Dallas was delayed by Radar problems at MEX. This set off a chain of events that resulted in a missed connection at DFW and while 90% could be attributed to the Radar problem. The flight was not posted on airport monitors and the gate was changed. The departure gate did not have the flight displayed so people had to ask if this was indeed for the DFW flight. Once on board the pilot announced a 59 minute traffic delay due to an early full ground stop. That 59 minutes went by plus another 20 or so with no further word from the crew. Late passengers arrived about an hour after the scheduled time and once loaded the door was shut and we pushed back. Since I signed up for Emails I received no fewer than 14 Emails that I didn't read until arrival in DFW which caused connection confusion that even one of their agents could not explain. As it turned out due to carry on bag only I could have made my first flight but apparently they gave my seat away thinking there would be no way I could make it. Coming into DFW I checked online and it showed what looked like I had been rebooked on the 2nd of 2 remaining flights but Emails after arrival which were generic made me think I had been rebooked on the first of the two. All 3 remaining flights were at different terminals which didn't help. Food offered on both return legs was ridiculous same thing on both flights which means they boarded the little biscuit sandwiches at DFW flew them to MEX to serve on the return flight.,2015-02-18,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,4.0,,0,,4.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,0.9490555555555555,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food

After waiting a while with no further time left to clear customs American told us to be re-booked each passenger would have to pay an additional $298 above the flight ticket already paid plus a fine. American refused even to ask if other flights (Delta or Jet Blue) had space later that day when no one was willing to pay all the extra charges to re-book on American the following morning or even tell us where the other two airlines were located. As it turned out Delta had only Business Class seats available (they said) but Jet Blue could accommodate everyone for a charge of $198 per person. American is clearly not very customer friendly and one would think twice about flying with them again in the future.

354,,american-airlines,,Jezrel Sabaduquia,United States,Premium Economy,5.0,JFK-DFW-GRU-JFK. First leg on a brand-new 737 seats were comfortable and flight attendants were friendly. They went above and beyond looking for an item that I lost during the flight checking the seat cushions and pockets and profusely apologizing when they couldn't find it. Next leg on the 777-300ER. Seats were once again comfortable although legroom was a bit tight but was not much of an issue since I had the entire row to myself. Recline was excellent although it was a little too much that when the person in front of me reclined there was very limited space. Flight attendants on this flight were once again very friendly and professional. Catering was excellent both quantity and quality. Return flight to JFK on a 777-300ER again. This time seated in Main Cabin Extra. Legroom and recline was great there were plenty of space to move around. Flight attendants and catering were once again excellent dinner was one of the best meals I had on a plane. Service on this flight was very attentive. So Kudos to AA! The only issue was the IFE had to be rebooted a couple of times other than that the system offers a lot of variety and options. Overall as a loyal United customer I was pretty impressed with AA!

368,,american-airlines,,A Sahni,United States,Economy,5.0,DFW to Milan Italy via JFK in December 2014. On check in for this flight at DFW the agent informs us the flight is over sold in economy so we inquire about being switched to British Airways on the non-stop to LHR then on-wards to Milan. The AA Agent looks puzzled and quickly said we cannot switch you to BA. At this point we are confused as AA/BA have a tie up we know for a fact Delta can put you on Air France if the flight is over sold. So then we head to JFK with the domestic leg good on a new plane. At the AA terminal 8 at JFK we come to find out the AA lounge coupons given to use are no good but the AA Agent in the lounge makes an exception for the lounge since Christmas is around the corner. Finally we board the AA flight to Milan. Since we own the AA credit card we are allowed to board with Zone 2 but the red jacket agent stops us saying your AA Credit Card is useless and does not work for zone 2. Finally get on the flight and the flight leaves on time. Meals and service were good as AA has to compete with Emirates on this sector but AA really lacks any economy class in flight entertainment. There are no personal TV screens in each seat like Emirates offers. The seats in economy class are too small on AA. Since AA has put TV screens every few rows no one can sleep on this flight as the lighting from the TV screens is very annoying. To end the flight the Breakfast was very good in economy. Overall if AA would match Emirates with proper in flight offering in economy class they would have a good product but till they do this one is better offer taking Emirates if flying to Milan in Economy class.,2015-01-23,,5.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,5.0,,1,,2.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,3.0,,,0.9091792929292929,General

381,,american-airlines,,K Wheelock,United States,Economy,1.0,Nov 10th AA2216. AA2463 Nov 11th. Our flight from LA to SYD was QF12 on Nov 11 2014. I would like to give American Airlines a poor review on their performance and customer service we experienced on a flight to Sydney Australia in November 2014. Our flight was delayed leaving MSP partially due to weather but really because they left us sitting on the plane while they delayed the de-icing and then took 45 minutes to do something the pilot said usually takes 15 minutes. We missed our connecting flight in DFW that was to take us to Sydney and the ticket attendants there absolutely refused to re-route us onto several flights that could have taken us to LAX to connect to a flight to SYD that same night. They instead put us on a flight the next day that would re-route us through LAX and on to SYD making us lose an entire day in Australia. The ticket attendants were rude and inconsiderate. I have never had such poor customer service in all my years of flying. DFW said it is a policy not to allow someone on a flight through stand-by if their end destination is international. American Airlines said each airport has their own policy on that and it is not a standard AA policy. There were several flights that went from DFW to LAX that evening and they allowed over 30 people to board those planes on stand-by but would not allow us to.,2015-01-19,,2.0,,2.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,2.0,,0,,3.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,2.0,,,0.98375,Food
382,,american-airlines,,S Dharmasena,Australia,Economy,1.0,JFK-SFO-LAX-LAS-JFK with American Airlines were the worst four flights of my life! Ground staff and cabin crew were rude and inefficient. The cabin and seats were very old and worn out. Not a single crew member on any four of the flights I took even bothered to say hello or welcome or even smile. Obviously we had to purchase snacks onboard because AA does not offer food. The snack options were very limited and if you were seated at the very back of the economy cabin you will never be guaranteed whether you will get the snacks you wanted to buy because they only stock few onboard and they get sold out half way through. Even during the selling of snacks and drinks the cabin crew looked very displeased that they had to do it. The cabin crew were extremely badly groomed. The economy seat had hardly any legroom. If you are a tall person you will have a hard time moving in your seat because it is so small with no legroom. We even bought extra legroom seats and still there was not enough legroom. All four flights were delayed and took off hours late. We were boarded late and then had to sit in the aircraft for at least 1 to 2 hours before take off. As a result our plans had to be cancelled and changed. I will never fly with AA again.,2015-01-19,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,,,0,,1.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,1.130297619047619,Cancelled Flight/Food/Flight Attendant

The seats in Business have lots of space places for storage and good size IFE screens. IFE itself is also good. Food was of a good quality. Service was very good from the crew who were pleasant friendly and were happy to keep your drink topped up. If you're feeling peckish during the flight the galley is stocked with snacks where you can help yourself. Overall a very pleasant on time flight. In contrast I flew the return with BA on a very worn 747 business class cabin is badly designed and crew not very friendly at all.

404,,american-airlines,,J Jensen,United States,First Class,3.0,"NRT/ORD 777-300 I hesitated booking F/class on AA even with award travel because of their flight attendants' general culture of hostility towards passengers but I reasoned I'd be asleep for much of the flight. We sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes before taking off. When returning to my seat from the lavatory after we'd finally reached cruising altitude a flight attendant looked at me coldly and barked ""Put your seat belt on!"". There was some turbulence but this was not the way to handle it. The purser was friendly and efficient but he referred to my husband as ""Mr.---- "" and called me ""Dear"". The new seats were very comfortable though and I liked that my husband and I could spin the seats to face each other while dining (although the food was surprisingly bad). I slept well on the comfortable flat bed. If the food and service were comparable to the seat it would have been a great flight. Until then I'll continue to book transpacific premium travel on Asian carriers.",2015-01-14,,2.0,,2.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,5.0,,0,,5.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,2.0,,,0.8879090909090909,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food/Flight Attendant
405,,american-airlines,,D Thorpe,United Kingdom,Economy,1.0,"I dread flying with American Airlines but with their association with British Airways (Who are fantastic) I have to for internal American Flights. Last flight was from Boston to New York with an onward BA connection to London. Arrived at Boston airport for check in very rude AA check in attendant who was unhelpful and just plain miserable. Onwards to the departure gate screens indicated a 25 minute delay. Was not too concerned as had around 4 hours to connect onto BA flight once landed in JFK. We then spent 2.5 hours waiting at the gate with hardly any communication from AA staff apart from ""Its a weather delay"" turns out it was due to a faulty aircraft door. Anyway the four hour connection time was fast approaching and people were starting to become annoyed and very irritated. Finally ushered onto the aircraft at speed as we only had a window of 25 minutes to board and be airborne if not flight would be cancelled as the crew would be out of hours. We boarded the aircraft and took off with around 4 minutes to spare. Seatbelt signs stayed on for the whole flight and apparently due to adverse weather the crew would also remain seated so no food or drinks would be served. I have honestly never been on an AA flight whereby the crew are smiling happy to serve you and are actually grateful for you flying with them and I have taken around 8 AA flights including across the pond the attitude at times is appalling. On the same holiday I was on a delayed Delta flight from Atlanta to Boston and the difference between staff was unbelievable was even given a free beer and sincere apology for the delay and more importantly was kept informed and the crew were cheerful and happy.

410,,american-airlines,,Liam Wills,United States,Economy,2.0,AA174 (Raleigh RDU-London LHR) on Dec 23 2014. We initially boarded the old rust bucket that is the 767-300 only to be disembarked a couple of hours later due to mechanical problems. They told us mechanics would have the problem fixed in 2 hours only for the inevitable announcement 3 hours later that they couldn't fix the plane and that we would depart the next morning. AA did provide hotels overnight but it was another 2 hour ordeal with 250 passengers lining up to see ONE representative. The next morning we all made our way to the gate boarded the same plane which the captain announced had been fixed and tested and waited for departure. Only we never departed. One hour later the captain announced the plane was STILL not fit to fly to the annoyance of us passengers. We had to wait a further 7 hours at the airport for another AA rust bucket 767 to come save us from London. After a 24 hour delay and 3 separate boardings for 1 flight we finally made it to London Christmas morning. My return flight (AA105) from London LHR to New York JFK operated on a brand new 777-300 was of course flawless. Lesson learned and tip: Do everything you can to avoid flying the 767 because chances are you won't be flying. They were good planes back in the 90's and 00's but they're unreliable these days. Moreover if you want entertainment and comfort avoid 767s at all costs. Ultimately AA is a good airline if you fly the right planes.,2015-01-14,,3.0,,3.0,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,5.0,,1,,4.0,,,,,,American Airlines customer review,,4.0,,,0.8320947570947571,Food

After a fiasco trying to find the lounge (building works going on and no clear notices) we'd walked the full length of the terminal to find our lounge had no Tim Horton's. Well it did but it was in the domestic flight section separated by a rope and we weren't allowed to duck under to get coffee so had to go all the way back to the far end of the terminal to get a coffee from Starbucks. That done we went to find Duty/Tax free shop. When we asked a member of staff where the Duty free shop was she smirked at us and said there wasn't one. Had I known this I'd have made my purchases prior to my flight to the States. Then we boarded our flight. The seats were ancient and everywhere appeared dirty. I'm 5'1 but was squashed into my seat which was lumpy and not comfortable at all. Dinner smelt like a cheap microwave meal and looked very unappealing. The staff weren't particularly helpful.

SEA-ATL flight was delayed by 3 hours and gate agents got us pizza and soft drinks and alcohol was free during that delayed flight (delays happen and these gate agents and FA's looked after us very well). Home-bound ATL-SJC flight arrived 25 mins late. The other 3 flights were on time and uneventful. The check-in gate and onboard staff were friendly and efficient. I was surprised to be offered 3 choices for dinner on transatlantic flights as well as a small mid-flight snack on BCN–ATL flight in economy class. Flight attendants were present through the flight. Seat-back screens provided great options for individual entertainment. The extra leg-room boarding priority and premium drink are well worth the cost of a Comfort+ seat. I wish seats were wider but this is true of every airline I've flown in economy class. Luggage arrived on time. I will recommend this airline for international flights.

Delta agent in PAP was very helpful and put me on the flight I asked for then Delta bumped me up to Business (Delta One). The new Delta BC with lie flat seat is really good. Window seats are even isolated (no passenger on the side). It is surrounded by the next seat which makes it a rather personal space. Having typically a low expectation of American carriers the upgraded Delta BC is surprisingly good. Dinner is simple and well presented service is quick and just what you need for a 7-8 hours flight. Connecting flight was slightly delayed but transit in ATL is actually relatively easy and straight forward (from flight A to B in less than 15 min). I know it's no Asian carrier quality but it is definitely changing my perception of US carrier and Delta seems on the right track to lift up its service. Will probably fly them again. Only negative point is arriving late in MIA there are hardly any Delta agents around (It's an AA airport!) so rebooking and hotel accommodation was tricky to figure.

The two younger female flight attendants were pleasant and tried to help but the older chief stewardess for Business was curt and initially asked me what I had done to the seat! As there were no spare seats in business and no first class section she was unable to re-seat me. They tried manually fixing it and re-setting the seat remotely electronically but didn't return to see if it had worked - I had to call them again - and and finally (after 30 minutes of wrangling with it) the head stewardess said the magic words ""sorry about this"" (the one and only apology). Really she couldn't have cared less and when she handed out mints at the end of the flight she didn't ask how it had gone or apologise again.

Long story short our plane was scheduled for a routine engine change on account of reaching so many miles. No one in the tower or the boarding team was aware of this. No matter who's fault it was the point is they obviously can't communicate and manage the airline effectively. Pathetic customer is service - it consisted of blaming the tower and pushing back the departure time every 15 minutes with full confidence that it would leave then. Well it didn't.

468,,delta-air-lines,,A Wilson,United Kingdom,Economy,4.0,BOS-CDG overnight flight on the 11th July and code-shared with Air France. Check-in was done via the Fly Delta app and was simple enough paid an extra £50 for exit row seats which I am conflicted about. On the one hand a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp. They were very loud boisterous and actually downright rude but the excellent crew put a quick stop to their antics once they were on the plane. Otherwise there were no delays. The flight itself was exemplary the staff were attentive and wonderful. The entertainment system is well-stocked and of good quality I also loved the genuinely entertaining and funny safety video. The food was adequate although I wasn't a fan of the meagre breakfast. No complementary alcohol on a long-haul also struck me as a little stingy. Overall I'm pleased with my experience and would recommend Delta to others.,2015-07-14,,3.0,5.0,4.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,8.0,,1,BOS to CDG,4.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,Couple Leisure,5.0,,,0.7416973886328725,Food

Flight to SFO was delayed by 30 minutes which meant I would miss my connecting flight to JFK. I was notified by emaila phone call and through the app that my flight was delayed. Within one click of the app I was offered alternate flights even alternate dates and airports without any extra charge. I was then rebooked to the nonstop flight departing an hour later but two hours earlier than I originally would have arrived. The agent at the SkyClub upgraded me to an exit row seat free of charge and apologized for the delay which was minimal in the first place. The delay was handled extremely smoothly and I was rebooked upgraded and taken care off within five minutes. The actual flight was good on board a Boeing 737-900ER and despite being only a year old the cabin was not properly cleaned and there was garbage on the seats. Legroom was excellent as there was no seat in front of me although it was a bit hard to see the television - it was about six feet away although DL was smart enough to put a remote control for these seats. Complimentary beverage served multiple times and buy onboard food options were decent. Flight attendants did their job were quite friendly.

484,Boeing 767-300 & Airbus A319,delta-air-lines,,Juan Eukel,United States,First Class,4.0,The terminal in SEA was unbelievably chaotic as it was a mix of overseas Hawaii and cross country flights. There was very little seating and the place was cramped. Good thing we only had to be there for an hour. The SEA to MSP leg was on an older 767 with upgraded interior. This was the domestic version so first class was billed as business and the seats was packed in a bit tight. In any case once again we had a great experience. Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant. My companion had the ginger beef and I had rice with shrimp and sausage. Again a slightly stuffy attendant but nothing to get into a fuss about. Seats had ample space and the aircraft though a bit old but was clean. One negative thing that was consistent on both the AUS-LAX-SEA and SEA-MSP-AUS flight was trash in the seat pockets.

This was the domestic version so first class was billed as business and the seats was packed in a bit tight. In any case once again we had a great experience. Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive.

They took all 4 of my family's bags and rudely told us they would arrive in SLC our final destination. A diff Attendant handed me 2 baggage labels.

Very short and acted annoyed that they had to give us directions to catch the new later connection. We arrived at the new gate to more Very rude Delta staff. Our tickets said not assigned so I stood in line at the gate to find out our new seats. When I approached the Delta staff I was told to sit down she was working on assigning seats (several passengers missed the connection). I tried to request that seats together because we were traveling with children on a 5 hour flight. She firmly told me to sit down. I felt like an idiot. They put us on the very back row with seats that partially reclined. Let's just say it was a long 5hours.

515,A320/B777-200ER,delta-air-lines,,M Howard,United States,Economy,3.0,DCA-MSP flight went smoothly. Smooth connection at MSP. MSP-NRT flight has many pros and cons. The seat was very comforatable compared to other airlines combined with a satisfactory IFE. The food could be much much better. I had chicken teriyaki for my supper and that was acceptable but breakfast was horrible. The appearance was bad enough the egg looking like a wet sponge without any air pockets and the sausage was burnt. But the taste was even worse. The fruit was acceptable.

516,,delta-air-lines,,Anthony Watt,United States,First Class,1.0,I made a reservation with Delta airlines in April 2015 for travel in July. I am a single father traveling with two small children (ages 6 and 10) and booked far in advance and in First class so that I could sit with my children. I was informed 24 hours ago that our seats had been changed and that I would not be seated with my children. When I called Delta to inquire (and after waiting more than 2 hours to speak to a representative) I was told there was nothing that they could do and that my children would have to sit by themselves. Despite the obvious safety concerns there is no way that I can assist my children with beverages or bathroom breaks if needed. If you are a single parent do not fly Delta.

The flight back to Minneapolis was also excellent. Boarding was orderly in both directions. Lunch was a large salad. However only one choice. It was a Salmon Salad. Quite a few of passengers turned it down including me. I was surprised there were not at least 2 choices. Once again First class FA was great. Waiting to board in both directions the checked baggage and the number of carry on is being abused. in both directions. People were checking bags that were huge. Not sure how they got past TSA.

542,,delta-air-lines,,T Lovett,Australia,First Class,2.0,We booked first class seating for the midnight to dawn flight from LAX (USA) to (SJO) San Jose Costa Rica so we would have lay flat seats and a good LAX lounge to use while we waited for our midnight flight. The seats did not lay flat. Delta cabin staff explained that lay flat seats are only available on First Class international flights over water. Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket. There was no inflight magazine for my seat. Upon requesting one I was handed a creased and folded one by a surly female cabin attendant. The Delta lounge in LAX was dirty and unkempt. Complementary drinks were limited to Bud Beer or a house white/red - anything else had to be paid for. Food was mixed nuts or pretzels. Undoubtedly the second worst flight I had the displeasure to undertake. The worst flight was the return from SJO to LAX. It compromised all the above plus the following. Upon taking our seat we were offered a glass of sparkling wine. Take off was delayed for 40min while a seat was repaired. We asked for a second glass of wine to while away the tarmac delay and was told that they only had one bottle for the flight and they had already used it. Classy eh? On arrival at LAX our priority First Class luggage was one of the last off - so much for the priority tag. I can only wonder how well Delta aircraft are maintained if this is their penny pinching standard in First Class.

The seats did not lay flat. Delta cabin staff explained that layflat seats are only available on First Class international flights over water. Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight even though some of it was across the Pacific Ocean. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. Flight safety is serious business. A safety briefing by a cabin attendant reinforces that. Downplay it with a cartoon gives the impression that its all one big joke. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket. There was no inflight magazine for my seat. Upon requesting one I was handed a creased and folded one by a surly female cabin attendant. The Delta lounge in LAX was dirty and unkempt. Complementary drinks were limited to Bud Beer or a house white/red - anything else had to be paid for. Food was mixed nuts or pretzels. Undoubtedly the second worst flight I had the displeasure to undertake. The worst flight was the return from SJO to LAX. It comprised all the above plus the following. Upon taking our seat we were offered a glass of sparkling wine. Take off was delayed for 40 min while a seat was repaired. We asked for a second glass of wine to while away the tarmac delay and was told that they only had one bottle for the flight and they had already used it. Classy eh? On arrival at LAX our priority First Class luggage was one of the last off - so much for the priority tag. I can only wonder how well Delta aircraft are maintained if this is their penny pinching standard in First Class. My view is that one should avoid Delta at all costs.,2015-05-29,,1.0,,0.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,1.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,,1.0,,,1.0105489417989417,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food/Flight Attendant

After waiting for the plane to arrive for 2.5 hours. When we get on the flight we had to wait another 30 minutes on the plane for more ridiculous reasons - they claim the baggage door was not shut properly. So someone comes to shut it and then we go out to runway. Then we have to wait another 13 minutes. Not able to rebook me for reasons that were also very vague.

579,,delta-air-lines,,W Rongu,United States,Business Class,2.0,I flew Business on an international flight aboard 767-300. The experience in the Business class is probably one of the worst due to the layout of the cabin. The Galley is in the front and in order for the flight attendants to service the plane down to the middle of the standard economy class they must go through the Business class cabin to reach the areas to the back. On other airlines such as ANA they have an extra Galley behind the Business and Premium Economy class seats so that there may be a separation in service and noise. The design of the seating arrangement in the Business class is much tighter in the Delta with its bulky boxy full-flat system that the flight attendants' hard foot steps with their high-heels can be felt bouncing through the walls of the full-flat system. What kind of flooring did they use in the aisle? Why do the horrible footsteps and cart sounds transmit so much to the boxy seat system? I could not rest quietly or comfortably as the massive loud obnoxious footsteps of passengers and flight attendants alike can be felt all throughout the flight. No courtesy there obviously no company policy there obviously to make the flight attendants wear something more quiet on their feet or to be more considerate when running down the aisle! The temperature control of the full-flat system is lacking. The seats themselves feel fine but they become very hot after a while and there is no air around the seat or your feet so there is no way to cool down. The attitude of the flight attendants is about what you would expect from a classless American transport company fairly lacking in manners and they treat you as if you're on a flying bus (as they have always done). The Flight Safety video is a joke as they intended it to be but it certainly doesn't make anybody feel safe as nobody remembers the actual safety bits but remembers the comedy bits! A total waste of time and energy and most certainly conveys what I said earlier about the attitude of the airline. It feels like a cheap low-class flying commuter bus service and they'll treat you like that.,2015-04-14,,2.0,,3.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,2.0,,0,,2.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,,2.0,,,0.9381746031746032,Flight Attendant

581,,delta-air-lines,,David Kaiser,United States,Economy,1.0,"My wife and I returned to Boston on Saturday from my son's wedding in New Orleans. I had booked Delta to and from New Orleans changing at Atlanta. On the way down a problem emerged. My wife generally signs everything Patti instead of Patricia. I had made the reservation for her for Patti as I always do. A TSA guy decided to make an issue of the difference between Patti (on the boarding pass) and Patricia (on her license) and sent her back to the Delta counter. They changed the boarding pass and all was well. We reached the airport in plenty of time Saturday morning in NO and tried to get everything done at curbside check-in. I got my boarding pass but the machine refused to give out hers. The guy checked the bag and turned us over to a Delta guy walking the floor inside. He put us in a large line for ""special problems."" Since at this time there was about an hour before boarding we weren't worried. However Delta was woefully understaffed the line moved with glacial speed. With about 20 minutes to departure my wife told me to board to make sure at least one of us got home and I did. Meanwhile I was in touch with my wife via cell she had finally reached the end of the line. They told her she was too late to make the plane. They told her she would be on the next flight to Atlanta and there was 20 minutes between its landing and our Boston flight departing so she might make it. Her seat of course had been given away. It turned out the name confusion was an issue again. I will never fly Delta again if I can possibly avoid it.",2015-04-14,,2.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,,,0,,4.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,,1.0,,,0.9829571222428366,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems

The newly configured Business cabin on the A330 is now my favorite on any airline or any plane. Very comfortable seat/lie flat bed and personal space.

The food and wine are excellent as usual and the IFE is industry leading. Let me not forget to praise the huge monitor for the IFE. Much larger than other airline's. Delta Business is my preferred airline for international travel. The only areas where they fall a bit short are in the crew professionalism at times. For instance on this flight I was never referred to by name which is just lazy.

They boarded basically by two zones after all the preferred boarding for the first/frequent flyer/credit card holders etc. I'm not a fan of the zones as you're always stuck behind someone but at least they turned back people who tried boarding out of their group. They advertise the flight with seatback entertainment on their site but I noticed after booking they often switch to a plane with dropdown monitors. On this flight it switched to an aircraft with dropdowns which actually was not as bad as I thought but not thrilled with how they do that. The overhead monitor showed the latest 'Hunger Games' movie and then the 'Minions' movie which is as good as I would have got with Live TV on the seatbacks. The monitors seem to be every 3/4 rows. They gave nuts/pretzels out twice during the flight which is not bad for legacy carrier and drinks twice. Price was comparable/just below other offerings and at the most convenient times. It arrived early to LAX and had no wait on takeoff due to mid-morning time slot.

624,,delta-air-lines,,A Stanton,United States,Business Class,1.0,"This is my first experience flying with Delta and I am extremely disappointed. My flight was canceled over 20 hours in advance and I was automatically reassigned to a flight departing 13 hours later. While I appreciate a seat at some point their were 6 flights earlier that I could have been placed on and I was not given a choice. I called Delta and had an associate inform me that I was ""not a priority"" because other flights before mine had been canceled. She also told me my departure weather was the issue she was incorrect. She did absolutely nothing to help me on the phone and was unapologetic. My co-workers on other airlines all departed mostly on time and make it to the same destination I was heading just fine while Delta continued to tell me the weather was not ok. I arrived at the airport at 5am and proceeded to sit in standby flight after flight. As I sit and wait for these flights they are all overbooked by at least 15 seats and I have had several agents act that I am an annoyance when I asked to be put on standby. The attitudes of the agents are generally distasteful and rude. They are treating us as if we are creating the issues and I have offered no apologies on behalf of anyone.",2015-03-09,,3.0,,3.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,,,0,,3.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,,1.0,,,1.0655555555555556,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Cancelled Flight/Food
625,,delta-air-lines,,E Berman,United States,Economy,1.0,On March 1 2015 my flight from Phoenix to JFK (1247) was delayed due to icy conditions in New York. My 2pm flight finally took off at 4pm. When we were an hour from our destination the pilot informed us that management was diverting our plane to Detroit. We were told that agents would be waiting for us at the arrival gate and would answer all our questions. The agents turned out to be one very disinterested agent who was talking on his cell phone when we arrived and only told us where to go for re-ticketing when prodded. He sent us to gate A53 that already had a line of 150 people when those of us in the back of our plane got there. There was a lone agent to answer all our questions and re-book each person individually. After 1 hour in line we hadn't moved at all. There were no announcements no accommodations no compassion or concern for your customers. No food no pillows no answers! Many of us had family back at JFK waiting for us and we had no information to give. That none of the 1200 people that were diverted lost it is a testament to OUR understanding and patience. Clearly the understanding was one-sided. No one blamed the inconvenience on the airline after all weather happens. What we objected to was the total ineptitude and lack of compassion of the Delta personnel. Eventually a fellow came around with one slice of pizza but I found out about that by roaming the gates looking for information. Most of us slept on the floor as there were no cots or sleeping bags given as an option. It is disappointing that Delta couldn't do better. Eventually some of us received a $100 voucher by insisting on some compensation for our discomfort. I don't imagine I will make much use of it as Delta will be a last choice of airline for me.,2015-03-09,,2.0,,3.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,,,0,,3.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,,4.0,,,0.9228609625668449,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food

We had just waited 45 minutes in the terminal for a flight crew. They board us and tell us weather stopped the flight. Don't insult our intelligence. That plane sat in my view for 4 hours and we were refused our luggage. 24 hours later no one at Delta knows where our bags are. We re-routed to OAJ customer service in Atlanta assured us they where re-routed. This was totally avoidable.,2015-03-04,,2.0,,0.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,,,0,,0.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,,3.0,,,0.92,General
634,,delta-air-lines,,M D Sperry,United States,Economy,1.0,In early August 2014 I booked a Business Elite ticket from STT to ATL for February 22 2015. My confirmation indicated my seat number and that a meal was included in my ticket. At check-in however I found that Delta had changed my status to Economy with a seat far back in the aircraft. When I called Delta to rectify the situation I and my Son-in-law were both treated rudely. We spent 2 hours on the phone with the result being that I should “ request to be upgraded at the airport. At the airport there was another 30 minute wait before I could talk to a Delta representative only to learn that I'd have to appeal at the boarding desk. A one hour wait ensued at the head of the line at the departure desk while the Delta representative ignored me waited on other people and fiddled with a computer terminal that wasn't working. The end result was the same rudeness and no help at all. I got neither the meal nor the priority baggage check-in that I had paid for. The flight was late arriving in ATL and I had to run to make my connecting flight to BOS. Delta had changed my seat assignment on this flight also. When I called to file a complaint the Delta Supervisor informed me that Delta changes aircraft seat assignments and passenger status without notifying passengers and confirmed that they had sold my assigned seats to more than one person and that these were normal”practices for Delta. I can't imagine why anyone would want to fly with Delta Airlines. Once they have your money they treat you like dirt or worse. There are plenty of other carriers out there. Based on this experience I can't see myself ever flying Delta again.

650,,delta-air-lines,,Brian Smith,Japan,Economy,3.0,NRT-PDX-NRT in Premium Economy. I'm a frequent flyer with Delta but usually fly in business class. Going to Portland the food was far superior to the food on the return I'm certain it is because of the high level of catering here at NRT. On the return the amount of food was not good either and there was no food available in the galley. I had to beg to get peanuts and it seemed like I was getting a big favor from the FA (hello 10-hour flight no snack besides ice cream). The seat has enough legroom has a recline that doesn't interfere with the person behind you too much except for making the AV angle uncomfortable to watch for the one behind. Great AVOD which is Delta's selling point in economy. FAs pleasant but not overly so-just doing their job. The toilets were not cleaned throughout the flight. They were stocked with paper products but never once cleaned and trash was overflowing. It was bearable but not enjoyable overall. Hard to come down from business class with a lie-flat seat and good food.,2015-02-18,,3.0,,5.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,7.0,,1,,3.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,,4.0,,,0.8780763416477703,Food

Unfortunately there was a slight delay due to 'mechanical failure' but I still arrived on time. FA were excellent with 3 drink services (I think) and offering coffee and water in-between. I slept about 1.5 hrs out of the three hour flight comfortably due to the lovely headrests that adjust in multiple ways. Didn't try to recline my chair however.,2015-02-11,,5.0,,0.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,10.0,,1,,4.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,,5.0,,,0.8285714285714285,General
665,,delta-air-lines,,Conyers Russell,Bermuda,Business Class,5.0,Suffering from a sinus/head cold I was not anticipating my return from LAX-JFK-BDA on a red eye. My flight was scheduled to depart LAX at 9.40pm and I checked in at Delta's Priority counter around 8:00pm and proceeded quite quickly thru security and found my way to a very crowded SkyClub. When we boarded the aircraft I was pleased to discover that this plane was a newly converted B-767 with the new Business Elite product-proceeding to my seat my coat was stowed and I was served champagne in a champagne glass (so unlike American who still give you those tacky plastic cups) for a pre-flight drink. The seat was 4A and quite comfortable and reclined to a full lie flat bed a nice pillow and quilted blanket as well as an amenity kit. As soon as we were air borne I changed into pajamas and slept most of the way to JFK. The crew were quite keen to help as were the nice ladies in JFK SkyClub during my transit time for BDA. The JFK-BDA flight was also very pleasant although I slept on that one also. All in all a very nice experience with Delta on this route especially with the new Biz Elite product between LAX and JFK-will look forward to doing it again.,2015-02-11,,4.0,,4.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,10.0,,1,,5.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,,5.0,,,0.7221801346801346,General
666,,delta-air-lines,,K Clark,United States,Economy,3.0,LAX-JFK-Zurich 24th Dec 2014. Return Jan 7th 2015. First leg of the flight came in late so we missed our connecting flight. They scheduled everyone who missed the connection on the same flight a few hours later ensuring it was busting to capacity. No seats unused. Even though I get airsick and need to be next to the window they refused to accommodate-even though I'd paid more for a window seat on the flight their delay made me miss. Then later delayed on the runway 4 hours-apparently because they were waiting for a manifest. The seats were just atrocious. I've flown economy all my life and never felt so uncomfortable.

672,,delta-air-lines,,N Stepp,United States,Economy,5.0,Columbus (CMH) to Managua Nicaragua and back. Personally I felt that Delta delivered an enjoyable experience and I would gladly travel with them again. 1) My initial flight from CMH to Atlanta went well. We left and arrived on time. The plane itself was clean and neat and seats were surprisingly comfortable although my shoulders could have used a little more room. Flight staff were courteous and even though we were on a booked flight I felt comfortable. 2) We experienced over a one hour delay from Atlanta to Managua and had to wait in the plane for about 45 minutes because of traffic over Florida (not Delta's fault). This plane was not nearly as nice as the first (no seat dividers) but the staff were friendly and the flight was still enjoyable. I flied in the Economy class upon my arriving flight. On the way from Managua to Columbus: 1) I flew in the business class cabin and was immediately greeted by friendly staff who were eager to give me whatever drink I desired. The seats were very comfortable and a delicious meal was served. The flight both left and arrived on time. 2) After arriving back in Atlanta we were greeted by an insanely long line to pass through customs. I don't know how much influence Delta had but I had a two hour lay over and just barely made it to my next flight. For the flight from Atlanta to Columbus I flew in the first class cabin which was surprisingly less comfortable than the business class one that I had been in previously. I slept for the majority of the time but was still given good customer service and the flight both left and arrived on time.

I flew economy on these flights. The seats were terribly uncomfortable (even though I was in economy comfort) and the conditions were deplorable. By the end of the flight bathrooms were indescribable! There was all sorts of trash and food in the aisles were the passengers had apparently not taken the time to throw their refuse away.

677,,delta-air-lines,,N Hartmann,United States,Economy,5.0,We flew TUS-ATL-EVV on the way EVV-DTW-ATL-TUS on the way back. We have two kids and traveling is not always easy. But Delta did a fine job of making things smoother for us by letting us board early and treating our kids very well. (They seem to be the only airline that still gives kids their wings). We were delayed getting out of DTW and the pilots openly made an effort to get us to ATL on time recognizing that people had connections to make. They were true to their word taking a shortcut and flying at a higher speed and we arrived in ATL 10 minutes later rather than the 30-40 we expected. The MD-90 we flew between TUS and ATL was brand-new inside and we were impressed by the service we received from the crew. The fact that you get a drink and a snack is nice I know people that fly Delta just for the Biscoff cookies. The planes are for the most in great condition though the Airbus 320 we flew had a few loose tray tables and could stand to be updated. I've been pretty dissatisfied with American airlines except for Southwest but Delta trumps all of them in terms of flight quality service and passenger dedication.

680,,delta-air-lines,,S Browning,United States,Economy,5.0,Connecting flight was boarding when my first flight was landing. Agent at the desk said she would call through but I had to get from one end of the airport to the other. I am an older person and went as fast as I could. My mouth went sandpaper dry and I felt quite faint only to arrive at the next flight to find the gate closed! It was Deltas fault I was late there should have been plenty of time between flights if they hadn't delayed so long leaving a small airport initially that didn't have a line up of flights going out. They spent too much time deciding whether or not to de-ice the plane! I'm glad they were careful and did it but could have got the job done a lot faster and got the flight in on time. As the plane for my next flight was still there I begged the agent at the adjacent gate to allow me to board as I couldn't spend the night and next morning in Minneapolis waiting for a flight to Newark. Fortunately she co-operated called through and they opened the door to let me on. I felt the stewardess was unfriendly as I boarded the plane probably thinking I should have been there on time. I think in situations like this there should be some pick up at the gate to get you to the next flight without having to nearly make yourself sick to get there and following flights should wait for all booked passengers making connections when Delta has caused the delay. This might have been a one off situation. I usually have found Delta friendly and helpful as the agent was who helped me to get on my flight.,2015-01-19,,5.0,,5.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,7.0,,1,,5.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,,5.0,,,1.0130494505494505,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Flight Attendant

Delta staff were not prepared to assist us in any way nor did they appear to be trained in customer service. This is just one issue albeit the biggest one that we had with Delta personnel giving incorrect information being rude (not the FA - this was all with the staff at the various airports we dealt with). The FA's were wonderful on all flights - perhaps Delta would best be served if they did the training to the airport staff.",2015-01-14,,4.0,,4.0,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,,,0,,1.0,,,,,,Delta Air Lines customer review,,1.0,,,0.885576923076923,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food

I don't care where I sit on the plane however when I'm traveling with my 10 y/o daughter or any family it's nice to sit with them. I would rather fly with an airline that assign seats upon check-in than to roll the dice to see if I can sit with my child. My first bag is free but to sit next to my child is $40 per ticket.

747,,southwest-airlines,,Carol Joseloff,United States,Economy,4.0,Traveled with spouse daughter-in-law and 18 month old grandchild. Purchased tickets for the adults in February paying extra for early boarding. Daughter-in-law decided she wanted to purchase a ticket for her child and have her sit in an airline approved car seat on plane instead of on her lap. Agent told her not to bother paying the early boarding fee when she purchased her child's ticket as the child would be boarding with her mother. My daughter-in-law traveled this way with her child several times on Southwest without a problem. However at Fort Lauderdale when she attempted to board the aircraft with her child the agent told her that even though her ticket listed her boarding group as A23 her baby's ticket said boarding group C and she would have to wait for that group to be called! During the heated discussion that followed several passengers behind us boarded the aircraft. Finally she was permitted on the aircraft. My husband went to sit in the seat across the aisle from us and was told that seat was taken. Another passenger claimed he was saving several seats (I believe it was 6) for his family. The flight attendant was standing just one row away and was aware of this behavior. My husband ended up sitting behind us. A woman who sat in the window seat near him plopped her bags on the seat and said to leave them there as she did not want to have anyone sit in the middle seat. It appears to me that Southwest needs to revise its seating procedure! If you have paid an extra fee for priority boarding you are entitled to board according to the status printed on your ticket. If your family members( who are not young children) have not paid for priority boarding you should not be able to block passengers from claiming a seat for which they have paid an extra priority boarding fee. If you are unhappy if someone wants to claim a middle seat too bad! You should be forced to sit there instead. The same goes for all the baggage folks drag on the plane. Half of the passengers look like they are fleeing a war ravaged land carrying on huge bags or multiple bags. If the airline would support their seating and baggage policies all passengers would be much less aggravated.,2015-07-08,,3.0,4.0,3.0,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,8.0,,1,FLL to BDL,2.0,,,,,,Southwest Airlines customer review,FamilyLeisure,4.0,,3.0,1.0382183908045977,Food/Flight Attendant

There were two people transferring from my connecting flight from Baltimore to Columbus. Two would you think that they would have the luggage at an easy to reach area. Now can't always blame the airlines for this. Lost luggage happens. However the reason behind my lost luggage was outrageous. After landing 15 minutes early of the scheduled landing time my flight waited for an hour on the runway. Almost missed the last connecting flight to Columbus. When announced the terminals they also noted that Southwest is not responsible for your missed flight if you do miss it. My flight left at 10.10 I boarded at 10. I enjoy Southwest but unfortunately my last couple of times flying with them have been miserable. The other time I was at the airport for 10 hours waiting on their planes because they were delayed in the schedule.

Southwest Airlines was beyond accomodating and helpful with all of their needs.

759,737-700,southwest-airlines,,Jeff Bradley,United States,Economy,5.0,My friend and I flew Southwest from DAY-TPA on June 6 with a return flight June 10. The outbound aircraft was one of the old Air Tran 737s a little frayed around the edges but perfectly servicable. The return flight was on a newer 737-700 everything was new and bright. Both aircraft were clean and staff was friendly professional and courteous. My only complaint was that the seats seemed a bit narrow and I am not a big guy. The outbound flight was on time while the return flight was delayed three hours by a thunderstorm over the airport.

We were delayed leaving because at the end of boarding one passenger didn't get a seat. That was because their system is not assigned seating it's open seating so nobody has a particular seat and nobody can prove which seat they are entitled to. From the announcements that followed it appeared that the problem was the lap babies-ones that were given free or low fares because they were supposed to be kept on their mother's lap (is that safe?). There were a lot of children on this flight. Apparently one of the mothers decided to give her child a seat instead taking up a paying passenger's seat.

790,,southwest-airlines,,C Stine,United States,Economy,4.0,SWA 737-700 IND-RSW March 21st. We booked Southwest airlines Wanna Get Away for a very cheap price so we could sit together we paid for early bird check in and we were in Group B. I have to say I will now be flying Southwest almost exclusively because of the free IFE (although you need a device yourself) and the service is great. The 737 is also one of the more comfortable planes in the sky and I would much rather fly on it than a small RJ on Delta or having to connect in Charlotte. Overall I'm very happy with this airline and I look forward to my next flight with them.,2015-03-28,,4.0,,,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,10.0,,1,,5.0,,,,,,Southwest Airlines customer review,,5.0,,,0.6561538461538461,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems
791,,southwest-airlines,,R Moore,United States,Economy,5.0,I have been traveling business select with Southwest twice a month for the past 3 years. I pay the extra money so I can board first to get my preferred window seat up close to the front on the Port side of the plane in order to quickly un-board either for another connection flight or to get on the road. My question is how can you rightfully sell a business select ticket when knowingly that there will be 40 people left on that plane during a connection which all 40 people will most always move forward after the un-boarding taking up most of the preferred seating area. Another question: I flew in on flight 2230 from New Orleans to San Antonio there was supposed to be no plane change in Dallas. Once we arrived in Dallas and everyone un-loaded except for the ones of us that were continuing on to S.A. Then we were told to get off and go to the next gate that there was another flight going to S.A. After several of us asked what was going on because of the plane change and the much later departure time of this flight (we never received an answer) then an hour later they announce that they are now waiting on another flight with 90 more people. This plane change and departure delay then became obvious there were no weather or mechanical issues they were combining 3 San Antonio flights into one to probably save fuel and personnel cost at the expense of their customer.,2015-03-20,,5.0,,,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,7.0,,1,,4.0,,,,,,Southwest Airlines customer review,,4.0,,,0.8593073593073592,Food

794,,southwest-airlines,,M Pratten,Australia,Economy,1.0,The worst airline I have flown. San Diego to Vegas Friday 13th Feb. At check-in told there is no allocated seating. Nowhere to sit in departure lounge hardly anywhere to stand. We were in one of the last groups to board as we moved into the line the girl handling boarding called us to the front to tell my daughter who is pregnant that she was allowed priority boarding as she is classed as disabled being pregnant. We accepted it and boarded sat at the rear of the cabin but luckily sitting together no room in overhead lockers so glad we had checked bag in. Never come across such an untidy cabin crew. Turned down the offer of a drink and was shocked they serve peanuts must be one of the few airlines that still do. Return flight on the 15th played the pregnant card for all it was worth boarded first row one seat locker for baggage no improvement in cabin crew. It was a once only flight with them we are spoiled in Australia with our airlines who get it right most of the time.,2015-03-17,,1.0,,,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,,,0,,1.0,,,,,,Southwest Airlines customer review,,3.0,,,0.9672723475355054,Food/Flight Attendant

OK can understand they are not responsible for the weather. We got on the flight to Dulles airport. However Dulles control tower had an incident and flight was diverted to the Baltimore airport (which was supposed to be not accepting Southwest airplanes). We waited three hours there to be refuelled and yes you can get out but for your baggage Southwest carries no responsibility. Not a weather related issue now. They claim no responsibility for the baggage. We could not afford a time to travel back 4-5 hours to Dulles airport from NY to retrieve our bags and had to wait. Got there about 2.30 am car rental with our reservation was closed had to spend more time and money for another rental not to mention the long drive to NYC after extra long trip from Denver. I would say that Southwest staff tries their best in the strict company policy limits.

819,,southwest-airlines,,A LeClair,United States,Economy,5.0,"I recently took a trip from Albany to Orlando and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the boarding process is a little strange as long as you check in on time there is a very good chance that you will find good seats even if you are traveling with family members. I got B27 because I checked in a little late but I was still able to get a window seat over the wing like I wanted. And since I only brought a suitcase and a small duffel bag I didn't have to check any luggage which is free for two bags anyway. I am 5' 3"" and small but I imagine that someone much taller and larger would still be as comfortable as I was in the seats. The planes were very clean and the staff were very welcoming and enthusiastic especially on the way down to Orlando. The flight attendants are quite funny during the safety briefing and manage to make you feel as if you are listening to a human being instead of a monotonous robot. They were also sympathetic when our flight back to Albany from Baltimore was delayed about an hour and our gate was switched twice and the captain addressed us personally to apologize. As all three of my flights were less than 3 hours each I didn't order anything but the complimentary snacks were a nice touch. Although each plane I flew on was wifi-equipped I did not purchase it but I did use the free flight tracker.

The flight (Jan 2nd #1043) was oversold. It took a while to find 3 passengers who agreed to take another flight by delaying their return to Chicago.

The International line was shorter so we were able to process through in a reasonable amount of time. It was a nice flight with no problems. For our return trip the hotel staff recommended that we get to the airport three hours early. The check in process was very well handled and we even went through the United States Customs before boarding the plane. This made it very easy when we arrived in Baltimore to grab our luggage and go. The return flight had the best flight crew I have ever flown with.

840,Boeing 767-300er,united-airlines,,M Tonelli,United States,Economy,2.0,My experience took a full 2 days when it should have taken only 15 hours. My family was booked with Delta. Our route was from PSA-JFK-ORD which would be operated by a 757-200. That aircraft was broken so we were rebooked with Lufthansa on a flight that would have taken us to PSA-MUC-ORD. Our flight to Munich was supposed to take off at 1pm we waited 5 hours until we could board. The flight to Munich was operated by Air Dolomiti we had a 1 hour 40 minute layover and I had a window seat on the long haul flight so I was happy. The boarding process was fast. Once we had boarded one passenger decided that he wanted to get off the plane that took an hour but the crew handed out refreshments and candy while we waited. When we took off we were 1 hour 20 minutes behind schedule and I knew that we had missed our flight. Our only hope was that it too was delayed (which it wasn't). When we arrived at MUC there were vans that would take people right to their connection from the plane. Unfortunately ORD was not among the destinations. We after spending 5 hours in a small airport had go and spend another hour in line at the Lufthansa desk. We were booked on a flight the next day with United Airlines. The next day we went to the United check-in and everything went smoothly. After the security checkpoint we had to do three more passport checks and one more baggage check before we were in departure for the U.S. Here we waited for 1.5 hours with no seats. We still hadn't gotten our seats so when last call had begun we marched up to the gate and demanded them. On the flight we had an 80's television and some okay food nothing special. The seats were uncomfortable and I didn't sleep one bit. We arrived on time only to find a large amount of international arrivals so the arrivals area was chaotic. In the Baggage Hall there were mountains and rows of luggage just taken off the conveyor belt just to make space for more arrivals. Then once the luggage came we had to wait for at least an hour to go through the last inspection and then we we were home free. ,2015-07-31,,1.0,2.0,1.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,3.0,,0,PSA to ORD via MUC,1.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,FamilyLeisure,1.0,,2.0,0.9034391534391535,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food

The way the United Airlines handled my partner's luggage that was left behind at our originating destination was a stressful start to our trip. Upon arriving at the airport around 5.45pm to catch our 8.20pm flight flight 5237 from Sacramento to Los Angeles on Monday July 20 2015 we checked in promptly and breezed through security. We sat by the gate with a plane that sat there for as long as we had little did we know this was our plane. By the time boarding came around our flight was delayed for another hour occurring multiple times for the next few hours. It was my hope that during the initial delay the service desk would help customers explore other options to reach connecting flights and/or destinations to avoid delays or issues upon arriving in Los Angeles. We were worried about missing our connecting flight the entire time. The second delay hits and people began to be frantic and changed flights. My party and I anxiously wondered if we were going to make our connecting flight or if we needed to rebook online. We called customer service a few times to inquire about alternative options but were never offered alternatives until hours later right before the last delay was lifted after 11am and needed to quickly decide on either taking the flight or flying out of another airport. I am baffled at the lack of customer service. My second and major complaint was the issue with our checked luggage getting left behind in Sacramento as we made our way to Cancun. We checked in before 6pm and sat at the terminal looking at the same airplane the entire time until we boarded it only to find out my luggage was never placed on the same plane. ,2015-07-28,,1.0,1.0,1.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,1.0,,0,"Sacramento, CA to Cancun, Mexico via Los Angeles, CA",1.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,Couple Leisure,1.0,,1.0,1.0627125850340136,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems

Our family of 5 (one of whom was a special needs daughter) was to fly from Buffalo to Chicago to San Francisco to Anchorage where we were to then start our Alaskan cruise. Upon arriving at Buffalo the check in machine didn't work right.

In Chicago we sat on the tarmack for almost an hour before we took off causing us to get in late in SF for our connecting flight to Anchorage. We ran to our gate as best we could with our special needs daughter saw our plane sitting at the gate but weren't allowed to get on due to the gangway being pulled away from the plane already even though the United personnel told us ""Oh we knew you were coming.

The pocket in fron of the seat was very low on the seat in front so that when I put my book in the pocket it bulged out so much that I had to keep my knees apart.

We get to the airport and go to talk to customer service prior to the flight to try and do a seat adjustment no one was there and they did not show until 10 min prior to boarding. The agent was very rude with my wife and refused to help and told her to talk to other passengers on the plane. We board the aircraft brand new to find that the seats were so close together that at 6 Feet tall my knees were in the seat in front of me and the entertainment system did not work. We board our second flight I sit down and literally have the seat back cave in with an audible pop. The seats should have been replaced years ago by the time we got off the aircraft 5 hours later my wife and I could barley walk. Coming back and go to drop off the bags they had 6 lines going and one attendant get our boarding passes and they had us divided up all over the aircraft talked to the gate attendant his response we have been paging you and was very rude with us.

864,,united-airlines,,Brian Fox,United States,Economy,2.0,"On Sunday June 14th my family and a close friend took a flight from Newark Airport which should have connected in Toronto to a flight to Dublin Ireland. Unfortunately because the Captain of the flight did not turn up for his passengers the flight was delayed for approximately 3 hours. (United Airlines staff in Newark informed us that this was the reason why we were delayed.) This was not a weather-related incident. In any event this delay caused us (and others I believe) to miss the connection in Toronto. We were not rebooked to another flight. Instead I was told that all of United's flights that night and following day were ""oversold"". I asked if we could fly home and was told that that would take days as well. The customer service rep in Toronto was particularly nasty and actually slowed down the entire process by training a new employee while talking to us. It should be noted that I was traveling with my 5 year old daughter who had not eaten for many hours and the slow processing and communications by this rep meant that nearly all of the shops and restaurants in the airport had closed down for the night. I asked if we could be put on another airline and was told that this was 'not allowed'. I also asked if we could get a flight somewhere near Dublin and was only offered a flight to Turkey or Frankfurt the next night. The rep did not offer hotel vouchers or food vouchers or any practical resolution but only intentionally took her time scanning flights. The employee finally got us a flight to London the next night and rooms in the adjacent hotel.

We then had to fly to Eugene instead rent a car and drive 2.5 hours to get to our destination (Bend). Then I was told my bag would arrive at our place of stay the next morning.

We had to return our rental car to Redmond rather than Eugene as that's where our flight was leaving on Sunday. Then the flight from Redmond to Denver was ""overweight"" due to temperatures in the area. We had to wait until 5 people volunteered to change flights before our flight could leave. I get to Denver only to find out my flight from Denver to SLC was delayed. Not to mention I already had a 3 hour layover and this delay made it 4+ hours. The flight continued to get delayed and didn't end up leaving Denver until about 1am. I did not get home until 3am. I am completely upset with my entire United experience and will not be flying United again. The customer service was awful.

They should have just given us the seats. My son was on a flight leaving Durango after ours for Denver and because of delays missed his connecting flight for Oklahoma.

Once we got on our way the flight attendants provided their usual sub standard service. However as this was a single aisle aircraft some passengers needed to go the bathroom and with drink service going on the access to the bathroom was restricted.

961,,united-airlines,,Len Gensburg,United States,,4.0,This was very much a bare boned flight. There was no in-flight entertainment. At the last minute as part of the closing doors announcement the flight attendant announced that entertainment was only available through the United app which she stated should be downloaded while we were on the ground. I'm fairly certain there was a charge for the entertainment plus a charge for the necessary wifi connection. The premium economy was okay.

The seat was dirty and sticky but relatively comfortable. No PTV. Asked for the advertised sparkling wine but was told they don't have it and instead was given cheap white wine in minuscule plastic glass. Twenty minutes after boarding we were told that there is mechanical problem with the aircraft and were told to go to customer service. Since it was almost midnight there was only 1 customer service representative for almost 300 passengers. Called their call center and was given last seat on the last flight departing LAX this night. It was economy middle seat in the rear part of the aircraft. Missed my connection to CMH in ORD. Customers service in ORD is awful. Representatives are not competent and are arrogant. Was told by one representative that no flight to CMH available today. When insisted (I am a Gold Premier) they found me seat on American flight but told me that I need to pay 374$ for this 50 min flight. I refused and asked them to put me on the next available flight which was departing 12 h later. They refused to give me a hotel voucher or meal voucher. I went to customer service in the terminal 3 and they gave seat on flight that was scheduled to depart 8 h later but put me on the waiting list.

966,,united-airlines,,C Shearon,United States,Business Class,1.0,As a loyal United Airlines customer with Global Service status for years that following experience has helped me realize United neither values my business nor cares about my experience with their company. On May 29th my direct flight from Dulles to Kuwait was diverted to Istanbul. The pilots timed out and passengers were stranded for over 12 hours in Istanbul- with no Turkish visas nor United staff to re-book and assist with hotels (United has no service in Istanbul agents were eventually flown in from the Middle East). Indeed diversions are neither planned nor pleasant; however passengers anticipated United would have had a contingency protocol in place for such events. After being left to fend for ourselves and spending hours on the phone (international roaming) with customer care passengers finally reached Kuwait the following day to ultimately learn that the remainder our respective original itinerary were canceled meaning onward travel and return flights to the US had to be re-booked. Shockingly United did not apologize for the inconvenience and (as of today- eg. 23 days later) has not offered to reimburse visa-on-arrival fees in Turkey nor the international roaming fees passengers encountered while trying on the phone with United’s “Customer Care” team. Furthermore all passengers paid for the flight from Dulles to Kuwait boarded the flight from Dulles to Kuwait and apparently since United diverted to Istanbul zero miles for the Dulles to Kuwait leg will be applied to passengers’ account as credit toward their annual status - seems unfair if United accepted the payment for the flight and we all boarded the flight. After over a dozen conversations with “Customer Care” leading all the way up to the Senior Manager for Global Services I am deeply disappointed to say the agreed upon follow-up that was supposed to occur 5 days ago has not. The Senior Manager did have one of his subordinates send an e-mail stating they will be in contact as soon as they reach a conclusion to my request. Wouldn’t it have been nice to receive a message stating “Thank you again for continued business and patience we value your business and as a customer and respectfully offer our apologies for the inconvenience reimbursement for the incurred expenses and credit of the earned miles” ? ,2015-06-20,,2.0,1.0,2.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,1.0,,0,Washington Dulles to Kuwait,1.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,Business,1.0,,,0.9807971014492753,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Cancelled Flight

Purposely booked a 2 hour connection at EWR given United's timeliness issues as of late. United changed the flights shortening the connection to 1hr 20. Called and had changed to a 3:25 hour connection. Stated I did not trust United with the shorter connection despite it being legal when challenged and the agent made the change without further comment. The outbound flight was late due to weather. Unfortunately all other EWR flights were showing on time as was the departure to MXP. Little communication from gate staff in Chicago. Arrived over 3 hours late in EWR with departure to MXP showing on time. After a sprint to the connecting gate the MXP departure pushed back multiple times and we finally boarded about an hour an a half late. Typical ‘old United’ flat bed which I like better than the Continental flat bed as it seems to have more leg room. Pillows and blankets have been upgraded. Ordered my meal on a tray in one go so I could sleep and all but dessert was delivered when everyone else was getting their first course. Food was decent much better than old United. IFE is sparse with less content than a few years ago but I have gotten in the habit of bringing my own and the power at the seat kept everything charged. Cabin staff basically disappeared once the meal was served – no one coming through or replenishing water. They appeared about 1:30 before landing for the breakfast service. We arrived about an hour late but the bags were delivered in a fairly timely manner and all of the bags arrived. My return was cancelled and I ended up on Lufthansa all of the way back. Much better especially seat comfort and reliability except for the food which I always find a bit odd on LH. Frankly I am starting to pick other airlines when I am in business class and I have the choice. In my opinion United has become very undependable both from a timeliness and baggage delivery standpoint since the merger.

971,777-300,united-airlines,,Paul Hanson,Australia,Premium Economy,4.0,Previously we flew United to the US in August 2015 - Sydney to SFO SFO to LAX then LVG to Sydney via SFO. No problems no delays no cancellations. This past May we flew again to the US with United. I have to admit that this time I was concerned as I had read many bad reviews about the airline. We had also requested upgrades on all flights to Business First and had been approved on our outward and return flights. Then my fears were realised when one hour after checking in online for our flight to SFO I received an email informing me the flight had been cancelled due to the inability to find a crew to fly the plane from SFO to Sydney. After a frantic call to United we were put on the LAX flight which left 2 hours earlier the next day. Of course we lost our upgrade but the customer service rep was good enough to put us in Economy Plus at no charge. Again my fears came back when we were at the airport to be informed that the flight was delayed due to the inbound flight being delayed at LAX. However that said the pilot was able to make up time in the air and we actually landed early in LAX and easily made our connecting flight to New York. This was the only problem we encountered with United on this trip.,2015-06-19,,4.0,3.0,4.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,6.0,,1,Sydney to New York via Los Angeles,3.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,Couple Leisure,4.0,,4.0,0.8973484848484848,Cancelled Flight

It took LH staff over 30 minutes to resolve but in the end I am sitting comfortably onboard. Boarding was efficient and smooth and my seat (exit row 28L) is perfect. We pushed back 5 minutes ahead of schedule. The cabin crew have been particularly attentive efficient and friendly. Beverage and meal service were quick. My only complaint is with the new economy drink and meal service. Although the inflight menu continues to list sparkling wine as available for purchase the reality is that in economy champagne is not to be had for love nor money. This is a discrepancy that should be resolved either by changing the information in the inflight magazine or preferably by restoring this purchase option. In any event I will continue to fly and enjoy United Airlines.,2015-06-17,,2.0,3.0,4.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,8.0,,1,MUC to IAD,5.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,Solo Leisure,5.0,,5.0,0.6714251893939394,Food/Flight Attendant
982,,united-airlines,,Krishnan Sureshkumar,United States,Economy,2.0,On May 21 2015 four passengers from my family traveled from Atlanta (USA) to Chennai (India) via EWR and ZRH by United Airlines. We each carried one small carry on bag. The airline refused to allow any of our carry on bag. We were carrying several prescribed medicines and one casual dress to use if there was any unexpected flight delay/cancellation. The airline reps were telling us that there is no space to put any carry on baggage. We begged them to allow at least 1 small carry on baggage instead of 4 carry on bags as we are international passengers and they refused it. They were so rude. They even threaten to call police if we don't follow their instruction to check in the carry on bags. They were even forcing us to reschedule our international travel to with our carry on baggage. Finally we did our international travel without any carry on baggage. We make international trips every year for the past 30+ years and United Airlines is the first airline that has forced us to do international travel without a carry on bag. ,2015-06-16,,,1.0,,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,1.0,,0,ATL to ZRH via EWR,2.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,FamilyLeisure,1.0,,,1.1125,Cancelled Flight/Food

On the way there at DCA there were two agents for about 150 people waiting to go on various flights. It took us a good 45 minutes to get through ticketing and baggage. We missed a connection because the
crew was still in transit to the airport and we took off hours late. Of course our luggage did not make it. It arrived at our hotel 3 days later. Our flight home was cancelled a few weeks before so we were forced to take one at 8am which meant waking at 4.30 am. We arrived at the airport boarded and were taken off the plane as it did not pass inspection. The flight was then cancelled and the next one was at 8pm arriving home at midnight. We went to the customer service desk with all 300 other passengers but decided to go to another customer service desk. The agent was nasty and sarcastic to those in front of us and to us. We had to fly to a city 2 hours from home - giving up our first class seats- and rent a car to get home uncompensated.

1027,,united-airlines,,Jennifer Frazer,United States,Economy,3.0,"I've been commuting between RDU to EWR for the past few months. As a loyal Delta flyer I transitioned over to United because they offer direct flights into Newark. What I've learned - you pay double the price for United as opposed to other airlines for delays and cancellations due to ""flight crew availability"". I had the opportunity to speak to a flight attendant about my weekly (yes every week) cancelation or delay and was informed that United was contracting crew out due to limited number of employees. Most employees have left because United pays them dirt. Shame on United and shame on the airline industry - those of us that fly on a regular basis (3 weeks out of the month) pay premium prices for a terrible experience. When I call or contact United - they could care less. Hence my loyalty to Delta - they listen acknowledge apologize and reword you for any and all challenges. As far as recommending United - use at your own risk and be prepared to have a Plan B C and D for when your cancelled due to lack of availability of flight crew.",2015-06-06,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,1.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,0.9765664160401003,Cancelled Flight/Flight Attendant

1031,,united-airlines,,Janice Wahl,United States,Premium Economy,5.0,"On May 22 2015 I flew from Newark to San Diego on a United B737-800/900 aircraft. This was the second leg of a flight home from Europe. The plane is fairly new and it is one of the most uncomfortable planes that I have ever been on. And that includes the medium and smaller commuter jets. This was a six hour flight. I booked this flight seven months in advance paid extra for the economy plus seating and selected a bulkhead isle seat in row 8 which was behind the ""first class"" section of the plane. However between the ""first class"" section of this plane and my row is what can marginally be called a restroom. It was a six hour flight and this tiny bathroom with a sink barely big enough to wash your hands was in constant use. Each time the bathroom door was swung open and closed those of us in the adjoining rows were assaulted with bathroom smells. After a few hours in the air I noticed that the bathroom smells were more intense and that the floor next to the bathroom door was wet. I spoke to the purser who jumped up and immediately locked the bathroom door and took it out of service. That was a good temporary fix. However I would like to suggest to United that they consider removing that toilet unit from this plane configuration. It really ruins the flight for those stuck in seats close by. Also this plane has hard vinyl seats and headrests and no entertainment screens. The seats on Southwest are more comfortable. This would all be OK for short haul flights but planes like this are too uncomfortable for cross country flights.",2015-06-06,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,3.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,,5.0,,,0.9446212121212121,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food

1038,,united-airlines,,J Allen,United States,Economy,2.0,"I was travelling from Orlando to Anchorage with a connection in Houston and San Francisco. When we arrived at the airport our flight had already been delayed by an hour and half meaning that we would miss our Houston connection. I went immediately to the service counter to have it sorted out and they had already switched us to a Delta flight transferred our bags and arranged meal vouchers for us. I was surprised at this high level of service. All in all we arrived in Anchorage on our Delta flight only 10 minutes after we would have arrived on our originally booked flight. Our travel experience back to Orlando was a completely different matter however. After arriving at Anchorage airport and checking in I realized that I had been bumped from my originally booked aisle seat to a middle seat in the same row. After boarding I realized that the seat that I had originally booked remained open so I simply picked up my stuff and moved to the seat I had originally purchased. This was simply an annoyance and source of confusion rather than a true inconvenience. The flight itself was rather uneventful. We made it to San Francisco made our connection and waited to depart. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Initially we were told that we were waiting for some baggage from a connecting flight they presumably boarded the baggage and we began taxiing. After taxiing for a few minutes the captain came over the speaker and informed us that we had to return to the gate due to a ""water leak"". We then sat in the plane for 2.5 hours while multiple maintenance men stomped on and off the plane trying to locate the source of the leak. After sitting on the (hot) plane for about two hours I had already finished the bottle of water that I had brought on board. When I asked one of the flight attendants if I could get some water she told me that I couldn't have any water because the maintenance man was standing in front of the bottle. Is that the one and only bottle of water that United stocked on this particular flight? I wandered back to my seat and endured the additional thirty minutes of idle waiting. Finally the pilot came back over the speakers and informed us that the ""water leak"" was actually condensation from the coffee maker that the flight attendants failed to wipe up after the last use.

1039,,united-airlines,,J Allen,United States,Economy,2.0,"I was travelling from Orlando to Anchorage with a connection in Houston and San Francisco. When we arrived at the airport our flight had already been delayed by an hour and half meaning that we would miss our Houston connection. I went immediately to the service counter to have it sorted out and they had already switched us to a Delta flight transferred our bags and arranged meal vouchers for us. I was surprised at this high level of service. All in all we arrived in Anchorage on our Delta flight only 10 minutes after we would have arrived on our originally booked flight. Our travel experience back to Orlando was a completely different matter however. After arriving at Anchorage airport and checking in I realized that I had been bumped from my originally booked aisle seat to a middle seat in the same row.

Got to Chicago told that plane was not going to St. Louis went to desk asking where was my flight to St Louis flight and when answer: the St Louis flight just left I can put you on standby on the next flight! Got to gate and asked for standby update told here would be one standby seat available as one passenger was not going to make the departure time I was not to worry about getting on the standby position was mine. When it came time for stand by to board another person's name was called. Went back to the desk asking why I was not the standby person answer: she has more status!

Per experience I usually allow a 90-120 min layover if I have a connecting flight which if you fly out of Pittsburgh it is almost impossible to get straight through flights unless you fly Southwest where unless you are a bouncer you cannot get a window seat to save your life. The flight from Pittsburgh to Chicago was on 'mechanical delay'. The 'mechanical delay' was about 90 mins which meant we would not make our next flight out of Chicago to our scheduled event that evening. However when we landed at O'Hare we were unaware that several flights were being held because of our delay. I asked a United staff member at our departing gate about our flight and he said ""it's departing in 3 minutes you will not have time to make the flight"". I went immediately to the Customer Service desk where many of my fellow passengers were congregating. While standing there my party heard our names over the loud speaker to board our flight. One party is physically disabled. Unfortunately we did not make the flight and we missed the first half of the event that evening. United should have contacted the gate to let them know we were on our way should have made arrangements for a cart for the disabled passenger in order to get us there in a timely manner.

1097,,united-airlines,,T LeGris,United States,Economy,1.0,We had a large group flying from all over the United States to Cancun for my daughters wedding. Every single person flying United had issues! My son's flight was cancelled due to no pilot. United then put him his wife and 4 yr old son on another flight. They had to fly from San Diego to Washington DC then to Cancun to make matters worse the weren't even seated near each other!!! How can they do that with a 4 yr old. I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours early and almost missed my flight because it took over 1.5 hrs just to check my bag and then was treated horribly. When we finally got on they plane the flight attendants were not friendly whatsoever and United in their ultimate wisdom decided that 7 meals would be sufficient for this 5hr 50 min flight. I fly at least 4-5 times a year and usually enjoy it. I will never fly United again.

1098,,united-airlines,,Rebecca Nelson,Canada,First Class,4.0,This is the second time I have flown United and it will be the last. The first time all the planes were late and we kept getting bumped to later flights. When we did arrive the luggage did not and it took four days to get the luggage. The second time I flew first class. After we checked in in Toronto we were put into a large area like cattle with no services and then lined up and herded through customs at the last minute so we were unable to get breakfast or buy magazines etc. one bag did not arrive with us but went to Newark instead of San Francisco. On the way home I was bumped to a different seat so I was no longer flying with my spouse and when I called I was told that is just how they roll and even in first class full fare seat booking are suggestions. In the future I will be flying Delta.

Our family booked our flights in January from San Diego to Florida. Sometime in February the flight time of our second leg of the flight was changed by about 5 minutes. Didn't think much about it. Just yesterday my daughter was checking her seating arrangements and realized that when United changed the second leg of the flight they dropped all our seats. There are no seats available. No help from the United reservation person who I could barely understand. We're all sitting apart. Good thing we checked our seating or we might not even had a seat.

Very disappointing when you can't choose what to watch on an 11 hour flight! In addition the level of service is not as good as Asian airlines that I've used on the same route such as Cathay Eva Air Singapore Air etc. When I asked to refill a water bottle the flight attendant said I would need to go to the galley myself to have it filled.

1109,,united-airlines,,Stephen Mordey,United Kingdom,Business Class,4.0,I took a trip from London out to Rio De Janeiro and from there to Sydney and back home after another stop over in Rio. My travel started on April 1st on UA 5 from London to Houston. I'm a 1k and upgraded this whole itinerary of about 48000 miles of travel from economy to business using mileage and a cash fee. All upgrades cleared in advance allowing me to select my favourite seating which on United one can do free of charge. I continue to be impressed at the level of courtesy and service in United's premium cabins. The vast majority of cabin staff gave very good attentive and professional service. Good simple food but very enjoyable and well presented. The fish dishes continue to be my personal favourite and were quite delicious. Frequent drink refills no need to ask its just given. Some really outstanding flight attendants. Some customers dislike the business class seating personally I have no problem with it. After a nice meal and plenty of snooze inducing beverages I can literally sleep for hours. The only downside in the whole trip was the closure of Houston Airport as a result of thunderstorms on 16/04/15. This could not be avoided or blamed upon the airline. End result I arrived at Rio on my way back 24 hours late. As a 1k a free phone call to a dedicated phone line got me rebooked on the next days flight keeping the upgrade. But I have to say that I did not envy the legions of poor souls who had to stand in line at Houston Airport that night to receive the same service from customer service. It seemed like hundreds of passengers waiting to see one or two agents working at 2am and it was not a pretty sight! All in all thirteen long haul flights apart from the one delayed by weather all other flights operated either on time or ahead of schedule. There are airlines out there that could not even come close to this level of punctuality. And as always my baggage appeared in the right place at the right time.

For some reason on the return we were bumped to business (first leg) then economy (last leg). For a six hour flight ""breakfast"" was a box with a roll candy bar and yoghurt. But the last leg we were seated in economy and the blinders came off. Seats were probably used on misbehaving prisoners - as ergonomic as a stone carving tattered ""leather"" painfully thin. Video screens (and I use the term loosely) had been randomly attached to the ceiling for which earphones could conveniently be purchased. I'm unsure which is worse - this or the ""individual screens"" on the last AA we flew - scratchy color off glaring possible the worst picture quality on Earth.

I would give higher marks for seat comfort except both ROC-ORD and ORD-ROC segments were on a regional partner using an ERJ-145.

This is the world's longest 787 route at around 15 hours so I would not even had considered flying United if they were using their old 747 with no IFE. This flight was excellent to the point I was wondering if I was actually flying United. I was in economy plus (which is not premium economy) but the extra legroom for a small surcharge really makes a big difference for such a long flight. The plane was brand new with excellent Panasonic IFE with very clear screen USB and power at every seat Wi-Fi which worked well for the entire trip good food and polite service. This was the best United flight I have ever taken and really feel they have a competitive product on this route (competing with QF A380). The only negative would be that you have to depart from the hideous terminal 7 at LAX. The return flight arrives at TBT to clear customs so think it would be much improved experience if UA international flights could depart from TBT as well.,2015-04-10,,4.0,,5.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,9.0,,1,,4.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,,5.0,,,0.8044214876033058,Food

The seat would not recline and the gentleman in front of me reclined so there was no room. My head was just inches from his reclined seat (I asked and he agreed not to recline all the way back). I was constantly bumped as people walked to use the toilet and the smell was terrible! I asked the steward why my seat was changed he said it happens all the time. You think you have reserved a seat in the middle of the plane but it is really further back. Otherwise no one would choose the back row. So I was tricked and according to the steward it happens all the time. He made no effort to apologize or make the situation right. It is one thing to realize in advance that the only open seat is by the toilet. It is another to pay that amount of money and reserved far in advance and get ""placed"" in the back by the smelly toilet. I put 1 star for food and beverages because I couldn't eat anything even the food I brought on board because of the smell of the toilet. I put 1 star for the entertainment because it required a credit card. I would have given negative for seat comfort and satisfaction if I could have.

I was constantly bumped as people walked to use the toilet and the smell was terrible! I asked the steward why my seat was changed he said it happens all the time. You think you have reserved a seat in the middle of the plane but it is really further back. Otherwise no one would choose the back row. So I was tricked and according to the steward it happens all the time. He made no effort to apologize or make the situation right. It is one thing to realize in advance that the only open seat is by the toilet. It is another to pay that amount of money and reserved far in advance and get ""placed"" in the back by the smelly toilet. I put 1 star for food and beverages because I couldn't eat anything even the food I brought on board because of the smell of the toilet. I put 1 star for the entertainment because it required a credit card. I would have given negative for seat comfort and satisfaction if I could have. I put 1 for staff service as the man in the seat in front of me was hit in the head by the trash bag every time the stewardess went by and she didn't even seem to notice. On the plus side it was terribly windy and the pilot did a good job with the landing.",2015-04-06,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,1.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,1.10351966873706,Food/Flight Attendant

1162,,united-airlines,,Marcel Bogaerts,Belgium,Economy,0.0,BRU-ORD-BRU. On the flight BRU-ORD the entertainment system was down so we had no entertainment at all. This was announced prior to boarding so it did not come as a bad surprise after take-off. This is not pleasant on a 9+ hours flight but United compensated us by serving all beverages for free including beers wines and liquor. After dinner the attendant even proposed to pour us a cognac without we had to asked for us. This is proper compensation and client care. The food was airplane food not great but the chicken was OK and before landing in Chicago we got a hot sandwich. On the flight ORD-BRU the entertainment system was working properly but the seatback screens on the Boeing 767 were utterly small. For dinner I ordered the pasta which was dough and something like tomato sauce not very tasty. Legroom was better than on most Asian airlines and attendants were courteous and caring.

United's 737-900 series aircraft are nice but the leg room provided hardly warrants first class. Wifi failed on every leg except SFO-IAH. If you navigate off the personal entertainment offering to wifi it is impossible to get back. So if the wifi fails - which it often does on United - you have nothing. Meals were improved over past on a couple of legs the same poor food as on the others. Wines still bad. Boarding ridiculous as Group 1 is now huge with no preference to First Class. I've flown the airline for years because of its dominance at SFO but take other Star Alliance airlines when going overseas.

The return flight was the real terror though. Our first leg from Orlando to Chicago was fine except for the airline insisting on checking our carry ons through to the final destination. Once in Chicago we were told our flight to Burlington was delayed due to mechanical problems. Eventually we boarded the flight an hour late and took off. We then turned back and circled O'Hare for an hour and a half due to mechanical problems before making an emergency landing and having to get off the plane.

At that point I was told there was no way to get me to Burlington before Sunday night (my original flight was Friday morning). I tried to book a flight to a nearby city and was told it was impossible to fly anything other than standby.

Group 1 which includes first class had about 90 people in Shanghai with the line stretching down the corridor. In fact there were more people in group 1 than in group 4 or 5. So much for First Class. The front cabin of B747 is old and dirty. Seat 2A has more privacy than most but overall the first class cabin is tight with very little privacy and people on top of each other. The seat is long and comfortable and you can sleep. The flight attendants…- one was pleasant and the other really did not care about anything. The food was horrible cold appetizer awful salad. The food lack warmth/taste/presentation. Breakfast was down right disgusting. Maybe this is because on the way to China I flew with ANA and the service is excellent and incomparable.

Instead my family of three is sitting in a hotel room with a 4 year old who can't sleep.,2015-03-24,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,1.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,0.8455357142857143,Cancelled Flight

1183,,united-airlines,,Susan Morris,United States,Economy,1.0,I booked a flight to Bahamas through United and it was their Silver Airlines. My flight over was late and coming back the plane had 20 plus passengers and we were all checked in and they delayed our departure. We all missed our connecting flights. There was no apologies no explanations. We were to depart at 2.25 finally getting off the ground at 6.25. Since I was heading to New England there were no seats and I had to purchase a new ticket on a different airline and could only get to Hartford. That ticket cost me $600 and I am very upset with their lack of customer service. My advice don't fly United Silver unless you have make your flights a day apart. This company didn't apologize and kept us in the dark.,2015-03-24,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,1.0,,0,,3.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,0.9177272727272727,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems

Very comfortable fully lie- flat seats. Food was actually pretty good. Service good. Nice array of films. We chose United for this trip due to price but were pleasantly surprised by how nice it was. Only two bags up to 70 lbs. each even in biz (some airlines allow 3) but overall we were happy.

But they continued to have us sit on the airplane for 3 hours and got upset when people stood up even though the plane was not moving. After the three hours they confirmed the flight was canceled. They set everyone up with a hotel and a new flight which was excellent.

1208,,united-airlines,,B Goldman,United States,Premium Economy,1.0,I flew from Puerto Vallarta (PVR) to DC with a connection in Houston. There were literally thousands of people waiting to check in to United flights in PVR with lines stretching the length of the entire terminal. Only four check in desks were open one was even closed. There were no announcements and a United rep went through the lines asking for passengers on the next flight only once. Flights out of PVR were delayed by as much as 2 hours or more. There was no help in Houston for people who would miss their connections. I arrived at my gate just before the door closed and the sullen attendant at the desk refused to ask permission for me to board. A few minutes later the door even opened to let out a passenger who had been checked into the wrong flight and the (now two) attendants refused to try to get me on board.

1209,,united-airlines,,Jodi Zigler,United States,Economy,1.0,We booked a flight from BWI to IAH for 2/22 at 7.10 am and were scheduled to arrive in Houston at 9.45 am. Instead we did not arrive until about 8pm. It was an all day ordeal and we lost an entire day of our vacation. United had mechanical issues on flight 234 but after many delay announcements it took them until about noon to cancel the flight. We sat on the plane for a short while then for many hours in the airport until they cancelled it. Then we had to go all the way back out to check-in to wait in a line for about another 2 hours to be told there were no flights at BWI to Houston that day. United employees were few and far between not nearly enough to handle the re-booking of an entire flight. Eventually we were bussed to the Dulles airport for a 4.30 flight to Houston. We were not given any food and United employees were short-tempered and quite helpless. I heard other passengers say they received food vouchers so I couldn't help but wonder why we were not given anything. Maybe it was because we were Travelocity customers rather than direct customers with United or maybe it was because we were very easy and never mouthy or difficult with anyone. On our flight from Dulles to IAH I was seated in a middle seat separated from my husband which was very difficult because of all the turbulence and my motion sickness. Our experience with United when flying back started out much the same - computers down very long lines and few United employees to help.

I liked Continental a lot so United when acting under the Continental side is wonderful. However I got a bit more ""tulip"" and less ""globe"" on my flight from Miami to Newark. The check-in and gate agents were wonderful as usual but the flight was delayed two hours before taking off from Miami. I completely understand this but I feel that more could have been done to get on the plane sooner. I cannot complain about the seats they were comfortable and made of leather (or a similar material). However I was appaled by the lack of entertainment. To a completely literal extent the options consisted of SkyMall United's horrifically boring magazine and the one radio station I could hear which seemed to be an 80's synth station. There was no Wifi no plugs and no TVs not even one. I believe this is a remnant of United. I flew the same route on Continental in 2010 and I received sufficient television programming. If I'm flying in and out of Newark a former Continental hub I deserve Continental service.

There is no room for peoples legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples health. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants beyond rude. I was shocked when 2 of them who could not decide if the liquid in the pots was tea or coffee simply removed the lids and put their noses in. When we got to Sydney Australia we embarked on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland. What a huge difference. All of the sudden we could stretch our legs. The food was edible and the flight attendants were courteous. Going back home to Canada the experience repeated itself. We flew Air New Zealand to Sydney and everything was good and then hell repeated itself when we had to embark Untied from Sydney to Canada.

1238,,united-airlines,,Ron Kuhlmann,United States,First Class,3.0,"SFO-HND/NRT-SFO in First. The outbound flight was so not First Class. The crew never addressed anyone by name-I think there were 6 of us and when my aisle mate had trouble finding the chest belt the FA motioned and pointed rather than walking to the seat to assist. The dinner was OK but there was no style in its presentation-or of any of the meal. The crew was present when necessary but had no real interaction with any passengers that I observed. The breakfast was insipid. Again poorly presented eggs lukewarm and the potato patty was soggy and blah as was the some-kind-of sausage patty. All in all it was a simply so far off the ""First Class"" moniker that I arrived feeling nothing but annoyance. The return from Narita was much better. United still lacks any sense of presentation or style but the crew was friendly present and engaged. The meals were both better than those on the inbound more tasty and hot but still far off the mark that is achieved by other airlines not only in First but even in Business.

When I asked what was on their food menu for purchase another roll of the eyes and was informed it was in the book in front of me. Leaving the plane you could almost hear the flight crew heave a sigh of relief the flight was over and they were rid of us the entire plane load. We were pried into our seats with a shoe horn and never in all my travels have I felt so claustrophobic - the 3 hour leg of the trip was almost unbearable to sit through.

I also however do believe that even the most affordable on-board service class should include some basics of travel and hospitality: decent amount of leg room (not extra but just sufficient) acceptable service and a friendly crew.

1262,,united-airlines,,Mohammad Afsar,United States,Economy,5.0,"Frequent flyer here. Worst flight experience I have had. Flight was supposed to be 53 minutes long. Got 44 minutes delayed due to late arrival of the plane. After boarding 15 minutes delay due to ""technical difficulties"". Smallest plane I've been in. Even though I wasn't planning on checking in my backpack the plane was so small that most passengers had to give their carry on luggage to the flight attendants to pick up from the luggage claim later. After landing (59 minutes after we were supposed to) the baggage claim carousel wasn't turned on until 35 minutes later! 2 other flights' passengers have landed after us collected their luggage from the carousel next to ours and left. Finally 40 minutes after landing (which is unusual for a domestic flight at a small airport) they started providing our luggage. The only good part about the whole flight was the behaviour of the pilot and the attendant. My ride was waiting outside for an hour and a half and I was extremely embarrassed.

1264,,united-airlines,,Tom Wooge,United States,Economy,1.0,In-flight service is long out the window video entertainment is endless infomercials and the last scraps of legroom have vanished into thin air. On a recent full flight from Newark to Los Angeles a new super skinny seating was encountered that climbs to a whole new altitude of pain and suffering. When reputable airlines change to slim seats the airline gets more seats on the plane and passengers get a bit more legroom but at United this would never fly. United now using Continentals short-haul 737-900s on long-haul routes has extra extra seats that don’ t quite fit. To make passable exit row clearance seats behind are compacted to even less than their typical 30-inch seat pitch on this aircraft - less than the 31-inches specified for many other flights - and much less than the 32-inches United advertises when selling economy seats. My seat had only 2-feet clear butt-to-shin with perhaps an additional 4-inch knee-high seatback thickness - probably a 28-inch pinch - or less! When the passenger in front tried repeatedly to recline - there being no extra room it was impossible. The passenger drew a cabin attendant to complain that I would not allow the seat to recline. The attendant seriously explained to me that the passenger had purchased a ticket entitling them to my leg space and may fully recline the seat. Unfazed the attendant told me that if I wanted extra legroom I should have purchased an“Economy-Plus” seat. I asked how much it would cost but there were no free seats - at any price. I explained that I did not need extra legroom just sufficient room - which they were not providing. Not reconciled to the laws of physics the attendant continued insisting that this was all my fault - that I was taking up space that I was not entitled to - and had me turn sideways putting my knees in the aisle so the seat could recline. My shoulder was now in the way of the seat. I could not turn back either and complained that the vending carts would hurt my legs even more than the seatback. Only then did the attendant finally suggest that the other passenger switch seats with their adjacent small child.

We bought tickets the previous March in order to get direct flights to the west coast and seats together. We chose to fly out of Logan - very inconvenient for us but the only airport offering a direct flight. A few weeks before our trip we received an email telling us that our flights had all been changed. Now we were leaving hours earlier getting in hours later with stopovers both ways. These flights were on Christmas day and New Year's Eve - clearly a few hours made a huge difference. Also our seats were no longer together. I will never fly United again.

1271,,united-airlines,,J Clifford,United States,Economy,5.0,MDT-IAD-LAS-ORD-MDT. Other than the leg from Dulles to Vegas the trip was largely a non-event. Even that leg the only real complaints I have is that it (B-737) was fully booked and the WiFi system on the plane was spotty. I do not recommend paying for the on-board WiFi systems until you've spent some time in the 'complimentary' area to make sure the system is working properly. The MDT-Dulles leg was a 25-minute trip not especially worth discussing. The Embraer 145 is a nice little plane the single-seat arrangement on the one side of the cabin does make a nice opportunity to get both a window and aisle seat. LAS-ORD was aboard an older 757. Seats were more comfortable than the 737 but in-flight entertainment was limited to basically an old Discovery Channel program on overhead CRTs. On the other hand it was free so I guess you get what you pay for. This plane was also fully booked but got lucky with a smaller woman in the center seat. ORD-MDT was aboard an A-319. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was available over a wi-fi connection to my tablet. Worked like a charm. Large selection of programming. Plane was about 80% booked and I got lucky with an empty center seat. On all 4 legs cabin crew was attentive and reasonably pleasant. Flights were on time or at least close enough that I had no trouble making connections. Notes: Bring a tablet or something to occupy yourself with. When the in-flight entertainment is right it works well. When it's not you'll be twiddling your thumbs without some way of entertaining yourself for hours. Do use the United app. Having the boarding pass on the smart phone - and getting all the necessary updates through the app - made things easier. It worked reasonably well. When traveling within the US (on any airline) don't go non-stop coast to coast. 5 hours on a fully-loaded plane is miserable (and lets face it they're all close to fully loaded today). An hour layover in some place in the middle is now a welcome respite and no longer a nuisance. Be prepared for delays. Stuff happens on every airline - mechanical and weather. My reading of the other reviews complaining about United strike me as largely problems that every airline is guilty of in some way shape or form. It is simply the reality of airline flight in 2014.

1277,,united-airlines,,R Cahill,United States,Premium Economy,4.0,United Premium Economy is a gamble it seems to be directly dependent on the type of aircraft you are flying. On a 777 the seats are nice and spacious the services (seatback entertainment) are premium and you can really feel the extra legroom making the extra charge totally worthwhile. On a 747 the opposite is true I had more room in Economy on an Airbus than I did in Premium Economy on a 747. On the 747 I couldn't even fit my very small backpack under the seat in front of me and what little legroom I had was obstructed by a large piece of plastic. The aisles were noticeably narrower as well which made every beverage service an exercise in getting smacked with a cart (not fun on a 13 hour flight). I did notice there was an extra seat in every row on the 747 which is probably were all that extra room went. Also relying on the old school movie screens meant that even if you were trying to sleep a bright light was shining in your face. On the bright side as always the crew were nice courteous and professional. Long story short though? If you're going to spring for the Economy Plus make sure you're on the right type of plane it makes a big difference.,2015-01-28,,3.0,,3.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,5.0,,0,,2.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,,2.0,,,0.7808035714285715,General

1280,,united-airlines,,Alison Pockat,United States,Economy,1.0,We had truly horrible service from the first flight out to the last flight of the return trip. United booked us to fly into Newark to connect with a flight out of JFK - we got the joy of finding this out when we checked in. On the return flight from Zurich the cabin crew announced that they were short staffed due to management cut- backs. Translation in our case where we were seated near the rear of the plane is that we got one small sandwich six hours into the flight. I would have killed for a glass of water and maybe some food. Then our connecting flight to Raleigh was cancelled due to 'weather' and therefore we were responsible for our own sleeping arrangements. The 'weather' in Raleigh was drizzle. Our bags went American and arrived on time. A complaint to United was not even met with an apology. Instead they offered of a $100 voucher for future travel with them!,2015-01-26,,1.0,,3.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,1.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,0.953125,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Cancelled Flight/Food/Flight Attendant
1281,,united-airlines,,Alex Ross,Uzbekistan,Economy,2.0,I try to avoid flying United when I can but as I was with Continental I sort of inherited their frequent flyer program. So my review is of a recent flight this last summer but also of their frequent flyer plan which unless you are a Business flyer I would avoid. It's almost impossible to move up to Gold with them. I flew 50K miles flew on them 4 times but failed to spend 5000 dollars on their tickets because I live overseas and usually fly Turkish and claim the miles because I thought they were in the same alliance which it turns out isn't really true - at least not for United. The flight we took was from London to Houston. Cancelled because it's United and we were placed on a flight to NYC in an effort to get us to a flight that connected to Texas which we missed so then they put us on a flight to Chicago so that they wouldn't have to pay for a Hotel etc ad nauseam. Funnily enough our flight back to London from Texas had one leg cancelled because it's United and they told us to drive from Austin to Houston but that's another story altogether. The plane we were on from London to NYC was just about clean enough my gluten free meal was gone because it's United (My flight had been cancelled and my meal with it) and the entertainment system was down because it's United. Needless to say I am now with the FF program of Turkish Airlines and will never fly United again unless it's impossible due to US monopolistic practices. Don't fly United.,2015-01-26,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,1.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,,1.0,,,1.0118572084481174,Cancelled Flight/Food

Flight attendants were hard to find for any extra drinks. 2.5 hours prior to destination captain turned on fasten seat belts sign due to turbulence hence terminating inflight service. There was no turbulence we were on top of the cloud layer. There was no turbulence during descent as well. I feel the seat belt sign was turned on to avoid further service to passengers.

I have been a loyal CO customer for about 20 years and have tried so hard to like the new United but my patience has definitely worn out. The service inboard is simply too hit or miss and increasingly miss. The FA's treat passengers like a necessary evil to be served minimally and with zero smiles or grace. The service is functional at best and once completed the FAs hide behind the curtain. Worst still their planes are already showing signs of ageing - on the outbound flight my moms seat reclined minimally and then jammed so she had to spend the rest of the flight bolt upright (she refused to switch with me). Notably the same seat was still broken 10 days later when she took the same flight home on clearly the same plane. Crew were indifferent to the seat problem. BA and Delta both have far more dependably good service and UA has simply stopped trying. I did a DL Gold status match for 2015 so will ditch UA after all these years.

I am a frequent Delta and Southwest traveler and was beyond disappointed with my experience on United. Our second flight was cancelled and it took someone over 15 minutes to inform us of this cancellation-additionally I was not notified via their app about this cancellation. It was 10am and they claimed they had no way to get us home that day unless we spent $80 to take a shuttle to another airport and then took two more flights from there. They then charged us three times for our bags. Overall (not including the two extra bag charges) this cost us an additional $180 and they refused to pay for a cent. I will never fly this airline again. Also as a side note as we spent the entire day in the airport we noticed that they overbooked every single flight some flights were overbooked by more than 10 people!

1313,,united-airlines,,Aliza Panjwani,United States,Economy,1.0,On our way back from Cancun we had a stopover in Houston. The flight from Cancun was delayed 1.5 hrs leaving us under 40 minutes to go through customs re-check our bags and get to a different gate in another terminal. We did not make our connecting flight. Along the way there were no helpful attendants and no actions taken to give us even a fighting chance to get to our gate. They attendants on the plane had no information about gates connecting flights or any other helpful info. We missed our connecting flight to New York. We kept getting sporadic ever- changing alert texts from United. Sometimes the flight was delayed by 2 hours and then reverted back to half an hour. We did not received a comped hotel and had to spend additional money staying the night at Houston. We were re-booked onto a flight the next day at 10.21 am. We arrived at the airport approximately two hours before the flight. Tthe flight was delayed 54 minutes and would now be departing at 11.15am. Shortly after we were told that the flight was delayed for 2.5 hours departing at 12.45pm. Having been up and at the airport since early morning we were famished. We decided to use the restrooms and grab a quick bite to eat as we had a 4-5 hour flight ahead of us. In that extremely brief time the flight time was reverted to 11 am. We received the notification at 10.30. After the flight was delayed 2.5 hours we made the rational decision to eat something in the meanwhile. Does United expect that it's customers not get up from their seats to relieve themselves get a drink of water or a quick bite to eat after having waited at the airport for so long? We missed our connecting flight again due to incompetence and poor customer service. We immediately went to an agent where we again received attitude and condescending lectures.

1315,,united-airlines,,Nicholas Edwards,United States,First Class,4.0,"Flew from LAX-LHR in Global First on the 777-200. Pros - Overall it is a very comfortable seat nice and soft bedding with a mattress pad small cabin (only 8 seats) great inflight entertainment system and friendly service. Cons - Food was subpar for international first and the appetizer was a spring roll and a coconut rubbed shrimp skewer - very similar to what you might find in a cheap cocktail party. Soup was served in a teacup sized bowl main was ok desert was ok too if you like ice cream as that is the only option. If United wants to compete with other international first class it needs more refinement style and ""class"" in their product. As I used award miles for this seat it was perfectly fine.

I had heard all manner of criticism about United beforehand however decided that given the effort by United to revamp the airline putting the 'Dreamliner' into service non-stop between MEL and LA it was only fair to give United a fair chance. United Airlines staff were nothing short of fantastic having arranged assistance for me on arrival at the various locations - in general over and above their call of duty.,2015-01-14,,5.0,,5.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,10.0,,1,,5.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,,5.0,,,0.7966666666666667,Flight Attendant

1344,,united-airlines,,M Dennison,United Kingdom,Economy,2.0,Flew from LHR to Orlando via Washington. At LHR the staff were very helpful in sorting out our ESTA cock-up (kids' passports had been changed since applying for ESTA). That is the only positive about United. The seats are uncomfortable and cramped the choice of in-flight entertainment poor (even if you could see it on the minuscule seat-back screen) or for the 2 hour flights pay-TV and the food absolutely disgusting. No snacks offered (I guess they are worried people will fill up on these having tasted the food) although available to purchase and no complimentary alcohol. Attendants fairly average and could certainly do with a better corporate uniform on trip out. On way back distinctly poor. Most worrying was the man who was on our plane and about 20 mins before take- off realized he was on the wrong flight only when somebody else came to sit in his seat. How is that allowed to happen on United from Washington? From a security point of view it is unbelievable and I wonder how the poor bloke fared trying to find the correct flight. Oh yes and over-booked flights which I thought were a 20th century thing.,2015-01-11,,1.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,2.0,,0,,1.0,,,,,,United Airlines customer review,,2.0,,,1.085422077922078,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food

1372,,united-airlines,,T Allen,Australia,Business Class,4.0,"We flew from SYD to LAX in United Airlines Business Class B777 service in December 2014. We were quite pleased with the overall experience. The seats proved to be comfortable in the sitting position. They were a bit too narrow though for comfortable sleeping even for a 5'2"" woman. In comparison my wife stated that her recent Business class long-haul flights on Qantas and Emirates had much better seats for sleeping primarily due to the greater width. She found it very difficult to get to sleep on the United seat although she noted that the United seats were more comfortable in the seated position. The length was felt to be adequate. Storage space was minimal but adequate for our needs. TV screens were very generously sized and of good quality. Food service was excellent in quality as well as the attentiveness of service and friendliness of the staff throughout the flight - deemed to be slightly better than both Qantas and Emirates in that respect.

Rebooked for same flight - 24 hours later. No vouchers no food coupons no apologies. Delays were admittedly due to weather in CLT and air traffic control response but given that trip was booked all legs through AA/US Airways would have thought airline could hold last flight for connecting passengers known to be waiting on tarmac for gate to make connections. Many upset AA/US Airways passengers were in evidence at Charlotte ""International"" Airport. Additionally rampant repeated misinformation and; unhelpfulness from US Airways/American Airlines customer service and airport staff. Were told by airport staff at gate we could reclaim luggage at baggage claim - could not be more wrong they would not ""pull bags"" so I wife and 2 kids stuck in Charlotte for 24 hours. Moreover had purchased $200 liquor in Duty Free in SJU but due to TSA regulations and because we left the secure area have had to improvise and box bottles for check-through on rescheduled flight - another $25 fee too boot. Don't know if they'll let me check (am writing from a hotel near airport during my 24 hour ""layover""). Even better - flight crew was at baggage claim and unable to find accommodation for the night - so AA/US Airways not only jerking around customers but crew as well (not surprisingly).

1390,,us-airways,,L Johnson,United States,Economy,1.0,The check-in process was good flight on time comfortable seats. My major concern was the flight attendants we encountered. Out of four flights on this trip we only had one attendant that we did not overhear complain about the airline. We sat in exit rows on all the flights and in seats that allowed conversation with them. We specifically chose a window seat for one of our legs of the trip but the flight attendant made a mistake and thought we were in the wrong seat because another passenger thought he had the window seat exit row. The attendant told us we were wrong so we made the move per request then quietly pointed out we had been in the correct seats all along. The attendant apologized but didn't ask the other passenger to move to his ticketed seat. My husband had circulation problems so we specifically wanted the seat we had requested as it allowed more leg room. When the beverage cart came by we did ask for a complementary rum and coke to compensate us which we did receive.

Despite telling them it was an international flight with a transfer connection and one party was on a wheelchair they still insisted. The kiosk rejected my attempts wasting about 20 minutes of my time. At check in the staff were rude and insisted that my bags were over the weight limit despite travelling in on a business class ticket.

1410,,us-airways,,Melanie James,United States,Economy,5.0,"This was the most horrible experience. We were trying to leave BWI when we got a phone call saying we were an hour delayed. Okay it happens. Someone from the airline was checking the people with connecting flights to make sure they could still make it he said we ""should"" make it. Well we had a gut feeling ""should"" wasn't enough so we went to another counter. They said we would have to change our flight because we would only have 4 minutes to make it to a gate on the other side of the airport before the flight departed. We wouldn't have eaten calmly and taken our time to do things if we were told that to begin with! So they tell me we will have to stay an extra 5 hours sitting at the airport to our connecting flight or that we would have to pay for a hotel and stay the night in Charlotte they wouldn't pay but regardless I had to be in Charleston that night. So I asked to be refunded because it was not sounding like great options. There was a sweet lady that helped us and told us to let the flight attendant know we had to make our earlier flight as soon as we landed. However when we got onto the plane about 2 hours later they delayed us another 30 minutes because of traffic. We wanted to leave I would make it driving down south faster than flying (and a lot cheaper) but a nice lady on the plane saw how upset we were and helped calm us down. She then explained that we wouldn't be able to make it to our earlier flight but that we could ask the help desk to get us seats on the 10:30 flight or have the airline pay for our hotel to leave the next morning because the delay was due to ""maintenance"" issues. We had no choice so she met us as we landed and tried to help us find an airport nearby our original location for a friend to pick us up at. Her shift was over and was beyond sweet for helping us for so long. She actually found us a flight leaving 15 minutes after we landed but they wouldn't have been able to deliver our luggage. So we took the seats on the 10:30 flight and of course without sitting together (I get anxious so I always need someone so my fiancé and I were upset). We sat there and of course they say they have to change a tire that would take a bother 30 minutes. That whole trip ended up totaling 11 hours after delays maintenance and layover.  The worst $700 spent for a mediocre travel that could have been avoided if they had their act together.",2015-07-11,,2.0,3.0,,/airline-reviews/us-airways,1.0,,0,Baltimore to Charleston,1.0,,,,,,US Airways customer review,Couple Leisure,1.0,,,0.9190972222222222,Flight Attendant

Delays cancellations overbooking etc have made it so there's always some issue when I fly with them. A couple of weeks ago a flight was canceled for some unknown reason and I had to fly into a city that was two hours away from my destination instead of having to wait in the airport overnight for the next flight. For the latest example my brother and I were flying out of NC and were told by the ticket agent that there were no seats left for us nor another person trying to fly to Charlotte. It's frustrating to be kicked off a flight that was so overbooked and there was no apology or compensation. ,2015-06-29,,,1.0,,/airline-reviews/us-airways,2.0,,0,EWN to PWM via CLT,1.0,,,,,,US Airways customer review,FamilyLeisure,2.0,,,0.6777777777777778,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Cancelled Flight
1440,,us-airways,,Diane Morris,United States,Economy,1.0,I do not blame airlines for the bad weather on June 23rd. Flights were cancelled on the East Coast. However I found the cabin staff very unfriendly and refusing to help. Due to reconnections because of the storm I boarded a flight from Hartford to Boston via Philadelphia. I arrived in Philadelphia late due to weather and then went to the gate to load connection to Boston. The guy taking tickets actually yelled at me for being late! Finally boarded plane and was looking for a place to put my overhead bag. There was a stewardess standing at the back of the plane and a steward standing in front. Neither one offered any assistance so I asked for help to locate a place to put my bag. I was told to just keep looking! Finally a young lady got up and moved her laptop so I could place my bag in the overhead. While struggling to lift my bag a gentleman sitting in a seat got up and helped me. Meanwhile the steward and stewardess were still standing in their spots! When I sat down the steward told people to put away their computers. A man sitting across from me started putting his away when the steward came back yelling at him because his was not putting his away fast enough!  I understand that everyone was under stress but that is no reason to treat people rudely!

1453,,us-airways,,Glenda Clare,United States,,2.0,We were to fly home from Cabo San Lucas on June 8th to make a connection with US Airways in Phoenix and then on to Omaha that same day. This turned into 2 days. From Cabo the plane was late by almost an hour. They never mentioned changes to connecting flights nor that we would not make it - we made it to the plane but to our surprise and 9 others they sold our seats to other people. The door was open the plane had not left but we were not allowed to board. We were told we had to wait and fly after midnight to Dallas and then Omaha the next day. We had to fight for overnight accomodation. We had no clothes - the bags beat us to Omaha.

If I'd known I would have been irritated but at least I could have prepared! When I asked for water from the beverage cart they wouldn't give it to me because it came with the meal (which I never got) and when I finally got a crew member to stop she didn't answer me when I asked for water but came back 20 minutes later with some.

1469,,us-airways,,Ken Walsh,United Kingdom,First Class,3.0,Yesterday I flew PHL to LHR on the day flight departing at 9.35am EST. This very tired old plane needs to be retired pronto as not competitive at all. Sat in row 1 with bulk head in front with a seat used typically from internal US flights not a standard transatlantic seat although seat card indicated being refitted previously plane felt in a sorry state. As I am tall the bulkhead prevented me from stretching legs out at reasonable angle you would normally expect - straight was not possible. Outbound flight to PHL from LHR was with BA and was usual solid service but this was shocking by comparison and not worthy of the fare at all (had this been a night flight I would have walked back off the plane in disgust and gone with any other airline). I urge nobody to pay for Business on this route if with American from Philly until they put the modern seats in. Entertainment is provided by a Samsung ipad like device - which is good but means you put it away when food comes they aslo take them all back way before we landed so did not get to finish two movies on a 6hr flight. Tray table can not come out and sit flat unless I am sat up right - this is a nuisance. I did not like the food one bit. I was at my most happy when I got off the late plane (late leaving as someone left passport in checked luggage resulting in waiting behind 17 planes to take off at PHL) - had sat in useless seat for 8+ hours as we were late.,2015-05-25,,2.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/us-airways,,,0,,1.0,,,,,,US Airways customer review,,1.0,,,1.0511059907834102,Food

1474,,us-airways,,J Spinelli,United States,Economy,1.0,My wife and I decided to travel to Anguilla for our honeymoon and booked our flight through US Airways. Being that it was our honeymoon I decided to call US Airways and find out the cost associated with upgrading our seats. However upon my conversation with the attendant was promptly made aware that the actual flights we were on had changed and our plane was now scheduled to depart and arrive at completely different times. Not only did they replan my arrival and departure times for me but they took it upon themselves to change my seats and not even assign me to two on my return flight. I am not going to say my honeymoon was ruined however when a merge causes a company to become so big they begin rearranging your plans it begins to make sense why they shouldn't happen. On a side note if we switched the situation and decided to change our flight instead we would be paying a $200 change fee and the difference in ticket price each. Not once were we offered an upgrade for the inconvenience or a partial refund for the change of flights which appear to be less expensive. I was previously a supporter of US Air however after learning that they can take it upon themselves to rearrange my honeymoon plans you can bet I am flying another airline for business moving forward.,2015-05-10,,1.0,,0.0,/airline-reviews/us-airways,,,0,,2.0,,,,,,US Airways customer review,,2.0,,,1.0483333333333333,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Food

The customer (dis)service person at the US Airways counter was rude arrogant and even threatened us with calling the police if we didn't leave the counter. We called his bluff and he put down the phone and printed us two boarding passes for yet another flight another 3 hours later. This flight was overbooked and we were not even guaranteed a seat. By this time I got on my iPad and booked a (surprisingly) cheap flight on another airline no fuss and we were on our way to Denver within the hour. It was just a nightmare day from start to finish but by some wild chance of a miracle we did find our luggage when we landed in Denver. Apparently the baggage handlers do know how to do their jobs.

1488,,us-airways,,George Phiver,United States,Economy,3.0,"Four flights from Phoenix to Philadelphia in April. Nice weather up and down the eastern coast. Flight from Phoenix to Charlotte taxied on the runway for 30 minutes and left 25 minutes late. Two of these flights had another crew on them flying home and they didn't have very nice things to say about their employer. Arrived in Charlotte as my next flight was just arriving ""late"". The passengers disembarked the flight cleaned and we boarded 30 minutes later and left the ground 20 minutes after that. Very little information about what was going on from the crew. Departing Philadelphia the flight boarded on-time but my original seat from what I reserved online was changed at check in and I was moved to the last seats and by a window and next to the engine. It was so loud I couldn't hear my music and had to fly with earplugs in my ears. After the captain figured out that he was on the wrong runway he told us and said there was going to be a delay of 15-20 minutes. When we finally landed at Dallas my flight was supposed to be boarding but after running to the gate the flight had been delayed due to weather and other flights. I had just come from the east coast and checked the weather and I didn't see anything that could have delayed a flight. I don't fly very much but this trip was ridiculous.

1494,,us-airways,,M Smith,United Kingdom,Economy,2.0,Flew from Washington to Boston on Economy. Arrived at the airport at 5pm for check in for 6.30pm flight. After several gate changes following a series of confusing announcements in an extremely overcrowded terminal the creeping delays started half an hour at the time. After an hour we were informed plane had landed but due to congestion there were no stands available. Finally boarding was announced at around 8.30pm after which it started to rain. We were then informed there would be a further delay due to the rain. We sat on the plane for an hour then taxied to the runway and waited another hour only to be informed that the flight would now be cancelled due to the weather. It was now after 10pm. On disembarking I was fortunate to be near the front so could be attended to quickly at the customer services desk for re-booking but I later realized others were stuck in a queue for hours late into the night. I was told flatly that all flights were full and overbooked until 10pm the next day. I was told rudely to 'take the 10pm flight or leave it' and as it was due to the weather it was not their responsibility to offer anything else (in fact the weather was just one of the contributing factors for the cancellation - the plane had already been late). I had to push and push to be offered alternative options (e.g. flights to a different airport or with layover etc). Eventually they found a flight via Philadelphia the next morning. I asked for more details and then agreed to be put on the flight only to be told I had taken too long to make a decision and now that flight was also full! I overheard other passengers being rebooked for other morning flights in adjoining desks so I have no idea what was going on. After much persuasion a seat miraculously became available at 11am the next day. Bizarre. I understand that delays and cancellations are not the fault of the customer service desk but they should at least be courteous understanding and helpful to passengers at a stressful time - not dismissive.,2015-04-16,,4.0,,0.0,/airline-reviews/us-airways,2.0,,0,,4.0,,,,,,US Airways customer review,,3.0,,,0.9593468468468469,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Cancelled Flight/Food

1501,,us-airways,,Sheri Hatt,Canada,Economy,2.0,Portland to Philadelphia Feb 22 2015 flight #4437 then #799 to Orlando. Returned March 6th flight #1757 Orlando to Philadelphia then #4437 to Portland. A terrible experience. When booking flights it asks if you are travelling with children which I was yet not one of the three adults that were travelling were able to sit with the child. When we land in Philadelphia we go directly to the gate so that there will be no worries of us missing our flight. The time comes when we should be starting to load the plane and my husband goes and asks when will be boarding and they inform him the gate has changed which they had not announced. Us along with most of the people sitting around us run to the new gate. When we arrive they there is a delay because they have to bring in a new plane once the new plane arrives they have to clean it after an hour they tell us there are problems with the plane. We wait again and they announce the pilot has run out of time and they need to bring in another. Our 6 pm flight ends up leaving at 11.30 pm. When they do start to board the plane the lady starts yelling at everyone to hurry up like we were the reason for the plane being so late. The return flight comes around and I am thinking surely this time things will be better - wrong. We look at our tickets to see if by any chance we will have someone to sit with my son on any of the flights No. Then I notice that on one of the flights I do not have a seat number. I go to the counter and ask what does this mean and I am told I have to check at that airport when I arrive. I ask does this mean I will not be on the flights? Oh no you will be. I get to that airport and am told the flight is full I will have to wait for another flight. I said no I am travelling with three other people my husband child and elderly mother - I then wait for hours in another airport. In the end I did get on the plane.

Flights on time aircraft clean and crew attentive - inflight meal ok. Cannot believe that US airways does not have inflight entertainment come on it's prehistoric! My other slight annoyance was that when I enquired if I could catch an earlier flight (checked in very early) I was told that would be $75 - my flight was full but the earlier one was less full...just appears to be cheap especially as my luggage caught the earlier flight (and I thought airlines tried to avoid unaccompanied luggage!).,2015-04-06,,3.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/us-airways,6.0,,0,,4.0,,,,,,US Airways customer review,,3.0,,,0.840392156862745,Food

The experience begins well before the flight and ends well after the flight. We flew to SFO from PHX this week. We were issued boarding passes and noticed we were in Zone 5. Well since the seats are reserved that didn't seem to be a problem until during boarding a gate agent came to my wife and told her that they were checking her bag ""because there wasn't any bin space left"" and we could go to the carousel at SFO to pick it up. My wife's bag is not large but it does have rollers and it seemed they were ""confiscating"" every bag in Zone 5 with rollers. We boarded the aircraft and discovered there was loads of bin space. I approached the First Class Cabin attendant and said I'd like to retrieve my wife's bag he said ""no it's already gone."" I asked why they were telling passengers there wasn't any bin space when there clearly was plenty of space. He offered a ""well they don't actually check it's just that at about this time in boarding there isn't much space left."" On arrival in SFO we thought well at least as the last bag loaded it'll be the first one off the carousel again we were mistaken. At least 50 bags came off before our bag and not a quick 50 bags. We discovered on our return flight (we returned from San Jose Airport) the same protocol was used by the gate attendant.

However the plane was one hour late in boarding in St. Lucia. Upon our arrival in Charlotte we were told there was no gate open for parking at the airport so we waited on the tarmac for a half hour or so.

My husband had TSA pre-check on his ticket however I did not. I had to go through a very long security line. My husband went to the gate to notify our plane that I was on my way - hurrying. Just as I finally ran to the gate (just at the 15 minute before flight mark) the flight attendants closed the door to the gate and would not allow me to board.

1520,,us-airways,,D Willows,United States,Economy,4.0,Seattle to Phoenix round trip. I was nervous about flying with US/American Airways after checking on this site there were so many poor reviews. When I got on the flights which weren't late or delayed by mechanical problems it was just like most other US domestic airlines I've flown on. The planes might have been a little old but they looked to be in about the same condition as a lot of other commercial carriers. Seats didn't seem to be any less comfortable leg room was average. Probably the biggest downside was that there was no inflight entertainment but they were only 2.5 hour flights so reading a book or playing a game was fine. The crews were nice not overly friendly and the pilots gave a few updates during the flight (both ways) which I always appreciate. I did notice that they didn't mention which baggage claim to go to at the end of either flight which would not be convenient for people that don't just do carry-ons. I'd say overall it's pretty comparable to most other airlines.,2015-03-09,,4.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/us-airways,8.0,,1,,4.0,,,,,,US Airways customer review,,4.0,,,0.9495,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems

1524,,us-airways,,Susan Mika,United States,Business Class,1.0,"I was very much surprised and disappointed on my recent flight from Paris France to Philadelphia. I have never seen stewardesses act the way they did on this flight. I am an American yet most of the passengers were European. First off there was a language barrier. Some of the French passengers were sitting in the wrong seats. The stewardesses were telling the passenger to move. When they seemed confused these airline employees started to become very rude telling the passengers that because of them the flight was going to be late. I have never witnessed such disrespect on the employees part I decided to just remain in my seat and do as told not wanting to experience their wrath. No such luck My husband and I were dozing when they passed out ice cream. I couldn't find a spoon with the container. Not wanting to ""bother"" the stewardess I started to eat the ice cream using the lid as a spoon. The stewardess passed by and took the ice cream from my hands and took out the plastic spoon that was contained in the lid. I jokingly said ""sorry I couldn't find it"".

But another plane was already at our gate so he pulled as close to the gate as possible so a bus was brought to the plane we got off on a bus and went back to the gate. Two hours later we got back on the bus and back on the plane. So now my flight was four hours late and of course I missed my connection in Philadelphia. When we got off the plane in Philadelphia they were very nice and they already booked my connection on a later flight to Milwaukee. Flight was supposed to leave at 8.30 but of course it did not leave at 8.30 because they did not have a crew for that particular flight. We finally took off at 11.10pm that night.

For the second time I missed my connecting flight in CLT to GSO because US Airways was delayed by two hours from my origin in Orlando. No explanation given but I am 100% sure weather had nothing to do with it as all was clear in Charlotte and Greensboro. The remaining three flights that evening were all overbooked. This is what happened before and I ended up waiting around trying to get on a flight all night only to be shuttled to a hotel to spend the night and hopefully get a flight the next morning. I wasn't going to do that again as GSO is only a 1.5 hour drive so I rented a car and drove home. Were they willing to reimburse my rental? Of course not instead they offered a voucher.

1532,,us-airways,,M Gallo,United States,First Class,5.0,Feb 17 flight 646 from PDX to PHX. On the same day I took flight 489 from PHX to PIT. I decided to fly US Airways PDX to PIT in February as the connection was in PHX and I was pretty sure PHX wouldn't have weather-related delays. I regretted buying my ticket after I started reading reviews about US Airways. And I was expecting the worst when I flew a couple of days ago. To my surprise it was actually really good. Both flights were early both planes had clearly been updated and were clean and comfortable. The flight attendants were attentive friendly and helpful. On the first flight which left PDX at 5.20 am the FA was careful to not wake people up while also serving those who were awake. When people woke up later and asked for things the FA served them breakfast and drinks with a smile. Breakfast was great - steel cut oats with fresh fruit dried fruit nuts (I don't like eating a huge eggy breakfast early (which was also offered) in the morning and appreciated this healthy choice). The two things that were disappointing about the trip was t he lack of space in first class on the 319 and the lack of entertainment system on a longer flight (4 hours). With regard to the seat when the person in front of me reclined I couldn't use my table and the seat was less than a foot from my face. I had to ask the passenger to move her seat which she was gracious about. But I thought that it was less space in first class than I get on some airlines in coach.,2015-02-24,,5.0,,0.0,/airline-reviews/us-airways,10.0,,1,,4.0,,,,,,US Airways customer review,,4.0,,,0.8238505747126437,Food/Flight Attendant

1540,,us-airways,,Alexnder Youngblood,United States,Economy,3.0,I have traveled with US Airways many times as I live in Asheville NC and the closest major airports are CLT and ATL. Therefore whenever I travel I almost only fly Delta or US Airways. Most recently I flew from CLT to CUN. Although the 757-200 had winglets and the fancy new AA paint job that could not make up for the dissatisfaction I experienced during flight. My seat was very uncomfortable and the cabin was very very dated. There was NO in flight entertainment (not even from the clunky overhead screen). The staff were decent but nothing spectacular. On the way back I flew on an A321 but it felt similar to the 757 I had flown on to CUN. I have flown on every type of plane in the fleet and every plane has this sort of feeling with the exception of the A330 (note: the A330 fleet still feels average when compared to other airlines but is better than every other plane in their fleet. The 767-200s in their fleet are horrible and the A320 family in their fleet is relatively shabby. Regional jets are what you would expect from a regional jet. Overall a horrible airline and as soon as I move out of Asheville to a larger city I plan on using another airline.,2015-02-06,,2.0,,1.0,/airline-reviews/us-airways,,,0,,1.0,,,,,,US Airways customer review,,1.0,,,0.9411710858585858,General
1541,,us-airways,,D Moore,United States,Economy,2.0,"Flew to Manchester UK. First leg (delayed). Second leg (PHI to MAN UK) we all get on the plane after slight delay and the pilot comes on and says ""We have to replace to doors on the front undercarriage - we'll be here about 15 minutes"". For the next hour we hear every 15 minutes that we will be on the ground for another 15 minutes. Finally we head for the de-icing stand. The pilot tells us that the plane had been standing at the airport all day and it would take extra time to de-ice. If the plane had been there all day why hadn't they taken care of the maintenance and got the plan de-iced before the scheduled departure time? Rest of flight is routine until we get to Manchester when they can't seem to get the jetway to roll up to the door. Come on people how hard can it be? So we have to wait for them to find some steps and we deplane onto the tarmac. Glad it wasn't bucketing with rain. On way back they book us onto a cancelled flight and don't tell us our connection is cancelled until we get to Philadelphia. What's more they think everything is cancelled for Tuesday too and they don't care! Customer service reps weren't even apologetic and certainly weren't interested in helping us get home. So we run over to the departures board and find jetBlue still has flights and we manage to get on a jetBlue flight. Re: Food. They served dinner at 11 O'clock at night - really? All you want them to do at that time is turn the lights down so you can try to sleep. Didn't eat it but it left the cabin smelling like a Russian cafeteria Then they served a pathetic breakfast just before landing when a decent breakfast would have been welcome. Totally ill-conceived. Re: Cabin crew: Perfectly acceptable. Did have an odd situation where the crew member asked me what I wanted to drink and then disappeared without a word (or a drink) and I had to ask again when they went by later but they brought me my drink quickly after that.

Yes this was after I informed then it was due to an old line-of-duty injury they didn't care. 2) Refused to waive a $450 difference for a flight two hours before the flight I was booked on even though the requested change is because of an impending snow storm starting when the flight I'm booked on is leaving. 3) Charged bag fees to Cancun Mexico even though it is an international flight and they don't charge fees for every other Mexican city they fly to.,2015-01-21,,0.0,,0.0,/airline-reviews/us-airways,,,0,,0.0,,,,,,US Airways customer review,,0.0,,,0.8863636363636364,Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems/Booking Problems
1546,,us-airways,,M Spencer,United States,Economy,2.0,We flew from Brussels to Philadelphia. Before we even took off the pilot announced we might have to stop to refuel which would delay our flight by an hour. That being said the plane was miserably small and old. The air conditioners were so loud it was difficult to hear announcements or talk to flight attendants. We had to stop in NY for fuel which delayed our flight by an hour and a half. We landed in Philadelphia at 3.10. At least 20 passengers missed their connecting flights in Philadelphia including ourselves. We were supposed to have a connecting flight to Nashville at 3.45. When we deplaned they already had new tickets printed for passengers who would be missing their next flight which was nice. The new plan was to leave for Charlotte at 5 and then catch a connecting flight to Nashville. It took them an hour to retrieve our luggage from the plane and another 20 minutes for us to get through customs and security. We rechecked out bags but they didn't ask us for any additional information just took our bags and said we were fine. The gate number for Charlotte on the ticket they had just printed was wrong so we almost missed that flight but made it just in time. We got to Charlotte and boarded for Nashville without any glitches. When we boarded for Nashville we sat in the plane for 30 minutes after our take off time. No one said why. We finally got to Nashville and our luggage had not made it with us. They said it was still in Charlotte. They are supposed to be delivering it some time today.

1562,,us-airways,,Kerynn Holtzman,United States,First Class,1.0,"I have always selected US Airways as my airline of choice. That will no longer be the case as of this last trip. I am completely unsatisfied with the way in which US Airways customer service dealt with a series of unfortunate events. I purchased 2 direct First Class flights from Washington DC to Phoenix AZ. Not only was the first flight cancelled due to maintenance we were then re-routed through Des Moines Iowa only to have our second connecting flight to Phoenix cancelled. Over twenty hours later we finally reached our destination. We lost a day of our vacation. I phoned US Airways customer care and thought that they would understand the following - 1) We purchased Direct First Class seats which are more expensive then multiple stop shuttle flights as well as foregoing the lunch even that should have been offered. 2) Cancellations were not due to weather rather maintenance (on two planes)- we lost a day of an already short trip to see family. I requested a change in the RT flights home by 1 day (same flight # etc) to allow our family to make up the time lost. I was told and I quote ""We got you there and that is all we commit to. Given you are requesting a flight change of your choice and not due to the airline there is nothing we can do for you."" The total cost to make the change is $600.00 per person. I was disgusted at the lack of care regarding the situation and further their lack of concern.

1563,,us-airways,,J Byers,United States,Economy,3.0,I have flown with US airways 3 times now and each time has been unpleasant. I wonder if this airline is ever on time. All flights were delayed - once for 12 hours. This time I flew to Puerto Vallarta from San Francisco. The flight to SF was delayed and I had to run with my carry on and barely made my connecting flight. On the way back the check-in service at Puerto Vallarta airport was appalling. I first was directed to a long line to get my boarding pass from a computer and then I had to wait in another line for the US airways staff to look at my visa. Had to board a bus to get to the waiting plane. I booked my ticket / seats well in advance and was not given the seats I had selected - I was seated in the middle over the wing on all flights - the one seat I did not want. When I complained I was told it was my fault for checking in late - I was early and had chosen my seat when I purchased the tickets. I was also told that I did not have the right status to guarantee my seat. On the flight from Phoenix to San Francisco also delayed it was difficult to even get a cup of water. All together a horrible experience.

Flying in MCS gets you complimentary meals and non-alcoholic drinks and the meals offered are miles ahead of what any other U.S. carrier would offer. Cabin crews courteous and efficient both ways though a big letdown was when I couldn't charge either my iPod or iPad in an e-mail I received from VX Customer Relations they stated that too many devices charging at the same time results in a drain to the onboard power it is something they're working on and I received compensation for that inconvenience.

I liked the mood lighting onboard and flight and crew very pleasant although the safety video was entertaining but to me a tad playful. The baggage charge of $25.00 was expected and on my return on the 10th of March I upgraded to First for $89.00 so the baggage fee was waived.

The worst part about the flight is not the lack of the above amenities which many of their competitors provide free but it is those things they call seats! The seats are horrible. An appalling substructure with about an inch of padding with no lumbar support. I am 6' tall and 190 lbs. I had the seat back reclined and the person in front of me did as well. I was reading the in flight magazine and I had 1"" from my stomach to the seat in front of me. What was more ironic however was the suggested exercises while seated at the bottom of the page to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Out of the four suggested exercises only two were possible with these ""new improved seats"".

1637,Boeing 747-400,united-airlines,4.0,Howard Cheng,New Zealand,Premium Economy,,"SFO-HKG yesterday. We had a really nice flight on Economy Plus - seats were comfortable with good legroom and good width (I'm 5""9) food was delicious and service was really good. Snacks and drinks available throughout the flight in the galley. Although there were not any personal TV's a few movies were played on the overhead screens. We were seated in 21A and 21C therefore we had a good view of the TV's. A flaw with United is the movies they show everyone on the overhead TV screens. I was shocked at amount of explicit sexual stuff in the movies and adding onto that - theft crime violence lots of kissing - in the movies they show. There were toddlers on the flight and lots of children/teenagers that mostly were on a school trip. As a teenager I was appalled by the entertainment shown to everyone - I believe that United should choose the movies that are shown carefully.

Everything about them is wrong. The seat bottom is too short the seat back is slumped or slouched even when fully upright and forces short-legged passengers to plant their feet into the floor to keep their hips from sliding forward and grinding their tailbones into the seat. The backs recline too far back to be practical in such an absurdly tight-packed cabin and will interfere with use of tray tables and hurt the knees of tall passengers unfortunate enough to sit behind a reclined seat. The armrests are far too low to be useful at all and dig into the thighs of virtually any average-sized adult. These seats are good only for illegal forms of ""enhanced interrogation"" and nothing else; three days after this flight I am still sore and have small bruises from the crap armrest digging into my leg. I'll do anything to avoid this terrible flight in the future.

Virgin America,Booking Problems,@VirginAmerica Funny story, your website is broken, you have missing javascript and stylesheets on the checkin process. I dislike this!

Virgin America,Food,@VirginAmerica What happened 2 ur vegan food options?! At least say on ur site so i know I won't be able 2 eat anything for next 6 hrs #fail
Virgin America,Flight Attendant Complaints,@VirginAmerica your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt
Virgin America,Flight Attendant Complaints,@VirginAmerica You'd think paying an extra $100 bucks RT for luggage might afford you hiring an extra hand at @sfo #lame
Virgin America,Flight Attendant Complaints,@VirginAmerica  for all my flight stuff wrong and did nothing about it. Had #worst #flight ever
Virgin America,Flight Attendant Complaints,@VirginAmerica husband and I ordered three drinks via my screen and they never came. Awesome!
Virgin America,Flight Attendant Complaints,@VirginAmerica All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row!
Virgin America,Delayed Flight,@VirginAmerica Love the team running Gate E9 at LAS tonight. Waited for a delayed flight, and they kept things entertaining
Virgin America,Delayed Flight,@VirginAmerica Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless
Virgin America,Cancelled Flight,@VirginAmerica @ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you!
Virgin America,Cancelled Flight,@VirginAmerica our flight into lga was Cancelled Flighted. We're stuck in Dallas. I called to reschedule, told I could get a flight for today...(1/2)
Virgin America,Cancelled Flight,@VirginAmerica I paid the premium to fly you across the country, you Cancelled Flight my flight and offer no check fee or upgrade love? Sad face :(
Virgin America,Cancelled Flight,@VirginAmerica While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck!
Virgin America,Cancelled Flight,@VirginAmerica I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday .
Virgin America,Cancelled Flight,@VirginAmerica I was really looking forward to my flight. can you let me know when it will be rescheduled? #diehardvirgin

Virgin America,Cancelled Flight,@VirginAmerica Flight from BOS &gt; LAS tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. No notification; wait times are 1+ hour. Will you rebook on another airline?
Virgin America,Damaged Luggage,.@VirginAmerica I don't understand why you need a DM to give me an answer on if you have a damaged luggage policy.
Virgin America,Damaged Luggage,.@VirginAmerica does that mean you don't have a policy for destroyed luggage?
Virgin America,Damaged Luggage,@VirginAmerica luggage was severely dented/missing wheel coming off baggage claim in SAN. Luggage agent Miranda (I think) wasn't any help.
Virgin America,Damaged Luggage,@VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
Virgin America,Lost Luggage,@VirginAmerica everything was fine until you lost my bag
Virgin America,Lost Luggage,@VirginAmerica We're on flight 910 Vegas to Boston today, checked in online but our bag count didn't register. Can I fix that somehow?
Virgin America,Lost Luggage,@VirginAmerica already contacted Central Baggage &amp; sent DM. @RenttheRunway is charging me for the dress that was in the lost suitcase #help
Virgin America,Lost Luggage,@VirginAmerica lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I'm calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff
Virgin America,Lost Luggage,@VirginAmerica my luggage is gone. I've filed my paperwork, promised a call/email. Still no resolution or response from central luggage.
Virgin America,Customer Service Issue,@VirginAmerica Your website is down and I'm trying to check in!
Virgin America,Customer Service Issue,@VirginAmerica you guys messed up my seating.. I reserved seating with my friends and you guys gave my seat away ... üò° I want free internet
Virgin America,Customer Service Issue,@VirginAmerica Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn't a great user experience.  Time for another redesign.
Virgin America,Customer Service Issue,@VirginAmerica what is going on with customer service? Is there anyway to speak to a human asap? Thank you.
Virgin America,Customer Service Issue,@VirginAmerica I called a 3-4 weeks ago about adding 3 flights from 2014 to my Elevate...they still haven't shown up...help!
Virgin America,Customer Service Issue,@VirginAmerica too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via YOUR confirmation email. When I inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks!
Virgin America,Customer Service Issue,@VirginAmerica can't check in, your site looks like this every time it loads http://t.co/kAcY2AwDbW
Virgin America,Customer Service Issue,@VirginAmerica I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I've been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes..........
Virgin America,Customer Service Issue,@VirginAmerica you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check.
Virgin America,Customer Service Issue,@VirginAmerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
Virgin America,longlines,@VirginAmerica at Logan airport and waiting to checkin for my 9am flight. Checkin desk not open !!!!! Why?!
Virgin America,longlines,@VirginAmerica
wjere is our luggage #so slow at lax
Virgin America,longlines,@VirginAmerica When will VX use all 6 LGA slots instead of 4 today? Adding AUS makes this less likely :(
United,Booking Problems,@united wasn't trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee
United,Booking Problems,@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
United,Booking Problems,@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
United,Booking Problems,@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
United,Booking Problems,@united Ha‚Ä¶ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
United,Booking Problems,@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
United,Booking Problems,@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?
United,Booking Problems,@united I am trying to book awards for September and need flights on @aegeanairlines but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab
United,Booking Problems,@united you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that's it!
United,Booking Problems,@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep.
United,Food,@united Brian at SFO customer service deserves a raise, gave me extra meal voucher and a good joke to cheer me up after flight delay. #FTW
United,Food,@united plus what about food? And taxis?
United,Food,@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the "broken lightbulb"
United,Food,@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?
United,Food,@united forces us to check our baby bag on overbooked flight complains to wife that we need to much for our baby.. united has no baby meals
United,Food,.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
United,Food,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
United,Food,@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
United,Food,@united KOA-LAX should have fresh food service, right?
United,Food,@united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it &amp; it's now impossible! I even called.
United,Flight Attendant Complaints,@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
United,Flight Attendant Complaints,@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice.
United,Flight Attendant Complaints,@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
United,Flight Attendant Complaints,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
United,Flight Attendant Complaints,@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
United,Flight Attendant Complaints,@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
United,Flight Attendant Complaints,@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
United,Flight Attendant Complaints,@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful.
United,Flight Attendant Complaints,@united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
United,Flight Attendant Complaints,@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
United,Delayed Flight,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
United,Delayed Flight,@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
United,Delayed Flight,@united good to know you will open the closed doors for "premier passengers" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed.
United,Delayed Flight,@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn‚Äôt exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
United,Delayed Flight,@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc.
United,Delayed Flight,@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent.
United,Delayed Flight,@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
United,Delayed Flight,@united three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats...
United,Delayed Flight,@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent.
United,Delayed Flight,@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn‚Äôt exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
United,Cancelled Flight,@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
United,Cancelled Flight,@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
United,Cancelled Flight,@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
United,Cancelled Flight,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
United,Cancelled Flight,@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?
United,Cancelled Flight,@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!
United,Cancelled Flight,@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
United,Cancelled Flight,@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. "No crew".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to "get to NY to catch @AirCanada" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead.
United,Cancelled Flight,@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
United,Cancelled Flight,@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning.
United,Damaged Luggage,@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
United,Damaged Luggage,@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
United,Damaged Luggage,@united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
United,Damaged Luggage,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
United,Damaged Luggage,@united I would like your baggage damage number as well! Another great thing from your 'trained' staff! Whats the number please.. Claim time
United,Damaged Luggage,@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
United,Damaged Luggage,@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
United,Damaged Luggage,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
United,Damaged Luggage,@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?
United,Damaged Luggage,@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won‚Äôt fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go‚Ä¶?
United,Lost Luggage,@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
United,Lost Luggage,@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
United,Lost Luggage,@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
United,Lost Luggage,@united @delta lost my luggage from ATL to  hdn luggage in denver and said @united will deliver my luggage to HDN airport claim# hdndl11785
United,Lost Luggage,@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
United,Lost Luggage,@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage‚Ä¶ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
United,Lost Luggage,@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one.
United,Lost Luggage,@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
United,Lost Luggage,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
United,Lost Luggage,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
United,Customer Service Issue,@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
United,Customer Service Issue,@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!
United,Customer Service Issue,@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but...
United,Customer Service Issue,@united Blackmailed me into paying ¬£130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
United,Customer Service Issue,@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you üò¢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!
United,Customer Service Issue,@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
United,Customer Service Issue,@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight.
United,Customer Service Issue,@united On last flight of the day no less. I am now driving 4 hours to Aspen thru a snowstorm Thx to your teams lack of customer empathy
United,Customer Service Issue,@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
United,Customer Service Issue,@united I would like to talk to a customer service agent about the service / non service I received on my last flight a a week or so a go.
J
United,longlines,@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around
United,longlines,@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!
United,longlines,@united Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.)
United,longlines,@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
United,longlines,@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night "as fast as they can", you should reconsider what you think that means.
United,longlines,@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off.
United,longlines,@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ
United,longlines,@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
United,longlines,@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
United,longlines,@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
Southwest,Booking Problems,@SouthwestAir that was supposed to say "boo" not book. booo.
Southwest,Booking Problems,@SouthwestAir love the passbook update. Used it the day after it was released. Finally!! Thank you!
Southwest,Booking Problems,@SouthwestAir it's pretty stupid and I probably won't fly it again. Plus hearing nightmare stories of overbooked flights.
Southwest,Booking Problems,@SouthwestAir Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch
Southwest,Booking Problems,@SouthwestAir currently rebooked thru Dallas but I hear they are expecting an ice storm (sigh) #strandedNYC
Southwest,Booking Problems,@SouthwestAir flying flight 3130 tonight at 7:20 from PBI- I have boarding position C-42. Is it overbooked? Really don't want to be bumped!
Southwest,Booking Problems,@SouthwestAir my ticket was booked 1/27 to CUN. Does the arrival time reflect that CUN is now on EST time?
Southwest,Booking Problems,@SouthwestAir is there any estimate on when the holding for you online will end? I'm at an hour and forty minutes now. I need to rebook!!!
Southwest,Booking Problems,@SouthwestAir been on hold for an hour. I need to rebook my flight that was Cancelled Flighted! #help
Southwest,Booking Problems,@SouthwestAir what about for us that cant get to the states they are playing for the hunt? Any DestinationDragons tickets left?Even just one
Southwest,Food,@SouthwestAir I'm going to start charging you for the consistent body pat downs. Starting to feel like a piece of meat. #punishedforflying
Southwest,Food,@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?
Southwest,Food,@SouthwestAir your "complimentary" hotel vouchers are BS! $79 a night for the crappiest hotel ever! I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy!
Southwest,Food,@SouthwestAir I'm running out of money to keep paying for hotel rooms &amp; food in NYC. You don't help people with $ spent
Southwest,Flight Attendant Complaints,@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC
Southwest,Flight Attendant Complaints,@SouthwestAir because according to the flight attendant my husband doesn't talk english, when the fact is that he understand and talks it
Southwest,Flight Attendant Complaints,@SouthwestAir had a very rude gate agent at BWI tonight gate B8 after a 6.5hr delay for flight 1172. I think a little training is in order.
Southwest,Flight Attendant Complaints,@SouthwestAir staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available
Southwest,Flight Attendant Complaints,@SouthwestAir now I'm so lucky for my forced good deed I get to be smashed between 2 huge ppl in the exit row. Thank God I'm tiny. üòÇüíÅ
Southwest,Flight Attendant Complaints,@SouthwestAir I want to file a formal complaint against a disgruntled employee @ LaGuardia who ruined mltple people's travel plans yesterday
Southwest,Flight Attendant Complaints,@SouthwestAir has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife, traveling alone w/our 2 young kids.  never again.
Southwest,Flight Attendant Complaints,@SouthwestAir RT @kkwhb: Paid for early bird boarding and got B46.  I said to lady, "well, that system is about dead." She didn't understand
Southwest,Flight Attendant Complaints,@SouthwestAir Ive had on an airline. Everyone else has been great but she soured the whole experience for me. Hope she's not there next time
Southwest,Flight Attendant Complaints,@SouthwestAir Gate agent gave me wrong departure info and caused me to miss my flight and now I am on stand by! #NotHappy
Southwest,Delayed Flight,@SouthwestAir flight 1028 no delayed 1.5 hours.  Another week another delayed flight
Southwest,Delayed Flight,@SouthwestAir Two delayed flights in a row. Neither one of them explained
Southwest,Delayed Flight,@SouthwestAir been sleeping on the floor like I'm homeless and now delayed flights because the equipment isn't working! I have a job to get2
Southwest,Delayed Flight,@SouthwestAir love how "friendly" your staff is when asking for updates on delayed flights causing missed connections. #horribleattitudes
Southwest,Delayed Flight,@SouthwestAir can I get any kind of update on the delayed flight from Boston to Houston at 7:30? Really need to be back home tonight!
Southwest,Cancelled Flight,@SouthwestAir oh and now your company has caused us to lose an entire day of our vacation in Cancun. De Boarded waiting for another plane
Southwest,Cancelled Flight,@SouthwestAir although I'm not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook
Southwest,Cancelled Flight,@SouthwestAir flight to Atlanta getting Cancelled Flightled and then had to re schedule on the phone for over 1.5 hours with a rep this bumping us
Southwest,Cancelled Flight,@SouthwestAir Flight 52 got Cancelled Flightled 6 hrs before takeoff. No Customer Service. Been on hold for 30 minutes.
Southwest,Cancelled Flight,@SouthwestAir SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays.

Southwest,Damaged Luggage,@SouthwestAir bag in possession but no clothes in bag??
Southwest,Damaged Luggage,@SouthwestAir Had a bad experience with them last week.  They broke my bicycle that I had brought with me to do a bike ride in Fla.  Why?
Southwest,Damaged Luggage,@SouthwestAir we didn't nothing was ruined just wet. Just frustrating when after traveling for 12 hours you can't change into clean clothes
Southwest,Damaged Luggage,@SouthwestAir everyone deserves red carpet tx until they destroy your luggage &amp;only give you $75 voucher, like I want to fly w/them again!
Southwest,Damaged Luggage,@SouthwestAir my golf bag was broken on the flight I just took. What's the process for damage reimbursement?
Southwest,Damaged Luggage,@SouthwestAir I'm so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn't help!
Southwest,Damaged Luggage,@SouthwestAir weather delays aren't your fault today but getting to hotel with two soaked suitcases and no dry clothes stinks frustrated
Southwest,Damaged Luggage,@SouthwestAir No. We were in a large group. Majority of the 30+ bags were soaked.
Southwest,Damaged Luggage,@SouthwestAir - our baggage motto: we don't cover that. Small tear, ripped seam, snow soaked, busted zippers - SORRY http://t.co/LHwFBKFynI
Southwest,Damaged Luggage,@SouthwestAir Kudos to bag handler at DTW gate 21 at 7:10 pm. Ran to keep bags from hitting ground in 9 degree temp! http://t.co/5tXU5tSFkJ
Southwest,Lost Luggage,@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
Southwest,Lost Luggage,@SouthwestAir been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me.
Southwest,Lost Luggage,@SouthwestAir  got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience.
Southwest,Lost Luggage,@SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time.
Southwest,Lost Luggage,@SouthwestAir "Will my luggage be on that flight?" "No" "Y not" "bc ur on that flight n it won't end up where ur goin http://t.co/6Zj6L2ZTua
Southwest,Lost Luggage,@SouthwestAir give us some more clever advertising about #bagsflyfree is that because #badpolicy allows you to #cheatcustomers
Southwest,Lost Luggage,@SouthwestAir when I called I was told my bag had made it to PHL, but still has not been delivered or any call from the delivery service
Southwest,Lost Luggage,@SouthwestAir should get their shit together before they owe my $2,000 for my bag.
Southwest,Lost Luggage,@SouthwestAir 3 + hrs w/out bags being returned to us after flight 2464 Cancelled Flightled. Maybe put a couple people on it?
Southwest,Lost Luggage,@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed.
Southwest,Customer Service Issue,@SouthwestAir Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!!
Southwest,Customer Service Issue,@SouthwestAir Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can't get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!!
Southwest,Customer Service Issue,@SouthwestAir your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix.
Southwest,Customer Service Issue,@SouthwestAir Worst customer service ever. You Cancelled Flightled my connecting flight to NY hours ago &amp; didn't tell me. Now I'm stuck in Tampa.
Southwest,Customer Service Issue,@SouthwestAir  on hold with customer service; you may be quicker.  I rebooked trip for a lower fare.  Where did the difference in $ go?
Southwest,Customer Service Issue,@SouthwestAir nothing you can do to help us restore some barely-expired #RapidRewards points?
Southwest,Customer Service Issue,@SouthwestAir on hold now for 1 Hour 25 mins Whats the holdup
Southwest,Customer Service Issue,@SouthwestAir now on hold for 2.5 hours waiting to speak to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight from Philly to ORL
Southwest,Customer Service Issue,@SouthwestAir still no update text #2053 &amp; still no response to email fr1/5/2015 SR #256746438028. Feel like yr losing customer service/care
Southwest,Customer Service Issue,@SouthwestAir Hey, friends. When I phone the A-list number your IVR hangs up on me. Multiple times. Not sure how to proceed?
Southwest,longlines,@SouthwestAir Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour!
Southwest,longlines,@SouthwestAir why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes?
Southwest,longlines,@SouthwestAir thanks, but they told him he couldn‚Äôt a few hours ago, then my plane left  after I tried to do it. Stuck waiting for hours now
Southwest,longlines,@southwestair three flights with three  check in agents, not enough. #missedflight  back to Jet Blue
Southwest,longlines,@SouthwestAir poor performance all around! Paid for Express checkin weeks ago and can't even leverage it #bullshit
Southwest,longlines,@southwestair please help us check in... i never expected you to make travel painful... just like the rest all of a sudden...#intlcheckin#
Southwest,longlines,@SouthwestAir @fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night.
Southwest,longlines,@SouthwestAir @ LAX is almost a mess. For some reason the express bag drop is slower than the full service line. http://t.co/ORY89eEGek
Southwest,longlines,@SouthwestAir update 35 minutes into this pilot has turned off a/c. No longer freezing, but we are enjoying waiting for reload of all bags
Southwest,longlines,@SouthwestAir I'm just calling to Cancelled Flight a flight. I already rebooked it on another card. Just need to Cancelled Flight the previous reservation.
US Airways,Booking Problems,@USAirways I've been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate.

American,Lost Luggage,@AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?
American,Lost Luggage,@AmericanAir Just got a call from baggage dept. "...still looking for your property". It's went missing 1/28. PRERECORDED NO HUMAN SERVICE!!
American,Lost Luggage,@AmericanAir even when I did get through, no one knew anything about my bag. This is ridiculous, I still don't have my bag from Saturday.
American,Lost Luggage,@AmericanAir westjet and your rep won't do anything about my lost luggage- which I never even checked with westjet because it was lost in

American,Customer Service Issue,‚Äú@AmericanAir: @Andrew_Wasila We're sorry you were uncomfortable, Andrew. What can we do for you?‚Äù SMA
American,Customer Service Issue,@AmericanAir so I have to call back at 9 since the department is closed. This has to be the biggest bunch of bull!
American,Customer Service Issue,@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
American,Customer Service Issue,.@AmericanAir can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.
American,Customer Service Issue,@AmericanAir. All I get is an automated system that hangs up on me. I finally get a message that some will call me back in 2 hours.
American,Customer Service Issue,@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest
American,Customer Service Issue,@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
American,Customer Service Issue,@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
American,Customer Service Issue,Yes, and it gets disconnected due to the lack of WIFI strength ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @MauererPower Have you reached out to @Gogo for help, David?‚Äù

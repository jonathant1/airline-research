united-airlines,Booking Problems,I got re- booked on the flight for the next day at the same time was given a night at hotel and $14 voucher for the meal for the whole day.
united-airlines,Food,So let me see, they could have waited 5-10 minutes for us to make our scheduled flight, or not wait and pay hotel and food for two people.
united-airlines,Food,I found all the staff I interacted with friendly and professional, the aircraft was clean, the food was fine but not enough.
united-airlines,Food,On my e-confirmation it clearly states “meal”.
united-airlines,Food,Beverage and meal service were quick.
united-airlines,Food,For a five hour Pacific crossing all we got was one drink service and food purchase which is unacceptable.
united-airlines,Food,Although it was a short flight, there was no meal offered, other than a quick snack.
united-airlines,Food,It's bad enough that the airline doesn't serve any food at no charge anymore but to top it off their in-flight service has got much worse.
united-airlines,Food,I went immediately to the service counter to have it sorted out and they had already switched us to a Delta flight transferred our bags and arranged meal vouchers for us.
united-airlines,Food,There was no food service on the Sacramento to Washington flight which is inexcusable on that long of a flight.
united-airlines,Food,The plane we were on from London to NYC was just about clean enough my gluten free meal was gone because it's United (My flight had been cancelled and my meal with it) and the entertainment system was down because it's United.
united-airlines,Delayed Flight,Our little one got sick on the flight and there were no bags, it looked like the plane had not even been properly cleaned before our delayed flight.

united-airlines,Delayed Flight,Lost bags delayed flights lack of communication wrong allocation of seats (such as row 50 in an airline that only has 46 rows) and rude staff have made my collective experience with United Airlines a negative one.
united-airlines,Cancelled Flight,They actually scanned our boarding passes in and had us lined up ready to get on the plane just to have us turn around and go back inside to later find out our flight would be cancelled.
united-airlines,Cancelled Flight,Also, their system has some sort of glitch today so apparently that means that had to cancel a ton of flights and delay many others.

united-airlines,Cancelled Flight,One of these flights was cancelled and United made no effort helping us to get another flight, so we had to book an additional flight on Southwest, causing us to lose a day of our vacation.
united-airlines,Cancelled Flight,As it was only 4 hours by bus from Chicago to Detroit, I decided to take mega-bus rather than to fly, and thank goodness I did that, because the rebooked flight on the next day was again cancelled due to air control issues!
united-airlines,General,What kind of business sense is that?
united-airlines,General,This trip we missed our connecting flight because we sat on the tarmack in Boston for an hour because they were having delays in loading luggage.
united-airlines,General,Every time I fly United something happens to derail my trip or make my trip miserable.
united-airlines,General,I have never had a good flight ok United or Air Canada.
united-airlines,General,Furthermore, all passengers paid for the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, boarded the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, and apparently since United diverted to Istanbul, zero miles for the Dulles to Kuwait leg will be applied to passengers’ account as credit toward their annual status - seems unfair if United accepted the payment for the flight and we all boarded the flight.
united-airlines,General,I swore I'd never fly United a couple of years ago this time I didn't notice the flight was operated by United.
united-airlines,General,Cancelled because it's United and we were placed on a flight to NYC in an effort to get us to a flight that connected to Texas which we missed so then they put us on a flight to Chicago so that they wouldn't have to pay for a Hotel etc ad nauseam.

southwest-airlines,Booking Problems,Add at least 2 hours to any trip you book with southwest.

southwest-airlines,Food,They never gave us meal vouchers or paid for a hotel.

southwest-airlines,Cancelled Flight,They also don't charge to change or cancel flights.
southwest-airlines,Cancelled Flight,We were told at the airport that we had been notified at 11.45 that our flight was cancelled.
southwest-airlines,Cancelled Flight,The notification about cancelled flight came in too late that could offer only flight to East coast to Dulles in Washington DC and that's your problem how you get to your destination (NY greater area).
southwest-airlines,Cancelled Flight,Horrible experience we sat in the plane for an hour only to realize that the flight was cancelled because a small plastic emergency sign would not illuminate!
southwest-airlines,Cancelled Flight,On the return leg they scheduled a Boeing 737-900 (bright and with lots of overhead cabin space) to accommodate the additional load due to storm cancellation the day before.
southwest-airlines,General,Their plane made it to the runway and now is receiving maintenance while passengers remain on the plane with no a/c.
southwest-airlines,General,Flight from Seattle to San Jose - flight 923 - landed on time, but the connecting flight to Ontario - flight 4032 - scheduled to leave at 8.30pm was going to be delayed to an unknown time, as the lady behind the counter was telling us that the plane encountered mechanical problems but would post the exact departure time as soon as the plane was airborne.

us-airways,Booking Problems,$25 for each checked bag is definitely a negative in my book.
us-airways,Booking Problems,We spent more or less an hour in the line for all passengers have to rebook their flight.
us-airways,Booking Problems,Delays, cancellations, overbooking etc have made it so there's always some issue when I fly with them.
us-airways,Booking Problems,Delays were admittedly due to weather in CLT and air traffic control response, but given that trip was booked all legs through AA/US Airways, would have thought airline could hold last flight for connecting passengers known to be waiting on tarmac for gate to make connections.
us-airways,Booking Problems,Rebooked for same flight - 24 hours later.
us-airways,Booking Problems,When booking flights it asks if you are travelling with children which I was yet not one of the three adults that were travelling were able to sit with the child.

us-airways,Food,Here's what went wrong: They didn't provide me with a gluten-free meal for all 15+ hours of travel and did not apologize or make any effort to find me something from the reserves I had confirmed online and at both airports that I'd have something to eat and they confirmed both times.
us-airways,Food,No vouchers, no food coupons, no apologies.

us-airways,Food,A nice touch on the outbound trip was a mid flight ice cream snack and the complementary wine with meals was also appreciated.
us-airways,Food,Entertainment is provided by a Samsung ipad like device - which is good but means you put it away when food comes they aslo take them all back way before we landed so did not get to finish two movies on a 6hr flight.
us-airways,Food,The plane had no video/TV screens and I had no tray available for the poor food service provided, could not even eat the "meal" provided.
us-airways,Food,Good food service.
us-airways,Delayed Flight,25 People waiting in line to book a new connecting flight since the now delayed flight (which we had to figure out on our own) would make everyone miss their connection, we are not spoken to, rather told to board the plane with a "50/50 shot you could rebook your connection in Dallas."
us-airways,Delayed Flight,We wasted money waiting around for our delayed flight and the only compensation we had was one free alcoholic drink on the way over.

us-airways,General,Flight was delayed 4 hours because the crew needed time off.
us-airways,General,Arriving at Orlando airport there was nothing less than disorganized chaos by the check in.
us-airways,General,Does US Airways only have one crew available?
us-airways,General,Even better - flight crew was at baggage claim and unable to find accommodation for the night - so AA/US Airways not only jerking around customers but crew as well (not surprisingly).
us-airways,General,US Airways then stated they could do nothing until the next day's flight to get us out.
us-airways,General,She then explained that we wouldn't be able to make it to our earlier flight, but that we could ask the help desk to get us seats on the 10:30 flight, or have the airline pay for our hotel to leave the next morning because the delay was due to "maintenance" issues.
us-airways,General,While I was waiting to take off I get an email from US Airways that due to the delay and me missing my connection flight I was being moved to another flight connecting from PHX to LAX and then to HNL but the flight wasn't until the next day and no mention of them paying for a place for me to stay.
us-airways,General,This is all suspicious to us as on our flight out of the U.S. we got delayed on the tarmac until the crew timed out thank goodness Delta helped us get us out!
us-airways,General,First flight we were able to get seats together arranged by agent at front desk but connecting flight the flight crew told us to ask people in the seats if they would switch with us.

american-airlines,Booking Problems,An hour later it was discovered that when re-routing us the person had neglected to issue us a ticket and now our flight was over booked.
american-airlines,Booking Problems,Coming into DFW I checked online and it showed what looked like I had been rebooked on the 2nd of 2 remaining flights but Emails after arrival which were generic made me think I had been rebooked on the first of the two.
american-airlines,Booking Problems,They are aggressive and used tactics trying to make me feel I was inadequate in my booking purchase.

american-airlines,Delayed Flight,On our return aircraft had an engine problem delayed flight for 4 hours missed connecting flight in MIA to NYC because of this issue.
american-airlines,Delayed Flight,Our delayed flight caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connecting flight- which ended up leaving 10 minutes early (I am not making this up)- meaning we missed it.
american-airlines,Cancelled Flight,I could not cancel even within the first 5 minutes.
american-airlines,Cancelled Flight,The flight was then canceled altogether.
american-airlines,Cancelled Flight,This again lead to an almost 2 hour wait in order to re-book after already waiting an hour prior to the flight being cancelled, causing many of us to miss our chance at making a compatible connection flight.
american-airlines,Cancelled Flight,We had to all disembark and after an hours wait we were told our flight was cancelled and we would need to rebook.
